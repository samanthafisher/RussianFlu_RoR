The Russian Flu project uses the open source search platform Apache Solr to index articles documenting the 1889-1890 Russian Flu.  The UI was implemented with Ruby on Rails, using the Blacklight plugin.  


Visualizations associated with the project include Google Maps and an interactive timeline to track the Flu's spread.

Within the repository, one will find the Ruby code associated with the front end (controllers, models, views....in the app folder), the infamous routes.rb file, and solr's necessary schema.xml and solrconfig.xml tailored to fit Russian Flu data.
