2	The Times	St. Petersburg		London		1889-11-25T00:00:00Z		Russia. St. Petersburg, Nov. 23. During the week there has been a most unusual case of sickness among all classes in St. Petersburg, which, from the semblance of the symptoms, is supposed to be an epidemic of influenza. It is averred that scarcely a family has escaped, while the numbers of those attacked by it in factories, workshops, and schools are quite phenomenal. In one of the larger mills as many as one hundred workmen at one time have been ill, and parts of the work have had to be suspended. The hospitals are overcrowded, and the doctors complain of too much to do. Most of the journals take it as a text for lamentations over the proverbial insalubrity of the city; others attribute it to the horrible weather of the last few weeks, which has consisted of a series of rapid changes between frost and heat, snow and rain, with heavy clouds and semi-darkness.  But if St. Petersburg is the most insalubrious of European capitals, Russia altogether is the unhealthiest country in the civilized world. The latest statistics of the medical department for 1887 show a less satisfactory state of the public health than those of the immediately preceding years. The cases of infectious diseases, although far from having been all chronicled, were much more numerous in proportion to the population than in England, Holland, Italy, Belgium, or Prussia; leprosy was found in 65 districts, and 615 fresh victims were registered during the year; there were 21 blind to every 10,000 inhabitants—a greater proportion than anywhere else on the Continent; and 27,017 persons poisoned themselves. Every year 15 more persons in every 1,000 die in Russia than in England, which, according to the Novoe Vremya, makes an unnecessary loss of 1,650,000 persons annually sacrificed through inadequate medical assistance. An example of this latter deficiency is given in the Caucasus, where there is only one hospital for every 309,000 inhabitants and one hospital bed for every 12,000.

Once this section settles down to a genuine cold it can keep the bulk of Europe frozen stiff for the balance of the winter quite easily. Perhaps, as a consequence of this change in temperature, St. Petersburg is suffering from a curious case of influenza. The type is as inexplicable in its way as was that queer epizootic complaint which ran its course among American horses some fifteen years ago. Practically everybody, from palaces to the lowest hovels, catches this strange disease, which, though not fatal, lasts three or four days and causes great annoyance. Over forty thousand cases have already been medically reported in St. Petersburg alone, with the result that mills and factories have had to close, and it is difficult to get cabs on the streets. The malady is now reported as appearing in Moscow and in far Siberia, and everybody is depressed over the unaccountable thing.			
7	Baltimore Sun	St. Petersburg		Baltimore		1889-12-01T00:00:00Z		Latest News from Europe. The Czar has for the moment ceased to think of the Eastern Question, having painful personal and family worries to occupy his spare tie. An epidemic of influenza of distressing intensity is raging at St. Petersburg, and at the present moment 40 per cent of the population are affected, the boom in pocket handkerchiefs being, in consequence, prodigious The infection spread to the palace, and worked its insidious way through the household to the imperial family. The Czar commenced to sneeze on Tuesday evening, and although he promptly and unselfishly quarantined himself, the Empress soon found her own normal supply of pocket handkerchiefs inadequate for increasing demands. Now the Czar, Czarina, and all the little Grand Dukes and Grand Duchesses are suffering alike in absurdly audible concert. Americans who stay at home at ease should not consider this matter too lightly, for according to eminent medical authority the tendency of this disease is to become pandemic. It will almost certainly spread to other parts of Europe, and there is not the slightest reason why it should not take a trip across the Atlantic. The last time it appeared in England epidemically was in 1847, and it is computed that upon that occasion 250,000 persons suffered.

It has not been long since the Pirea announced the extraordinarily rapid spread of the disease known as dengue. Shortly there after, Greece and the Ottoman Empire were affected by the same disease. Today the telegramas announced that 150,000 people are sick with the dengue in the Russian capital.  Historically, the disease now known as dengue was called the flu in Spain, break bones in England, and pantomime or polka fever in Italy.  In 1867 this disease spread to many cities in Southern SPain, among those was Cádiz. The people of Cádiz witnesses that the hallmark symptom of the disease was a certain cuddliness or affection among the victims. Examining their good humor they called the infirm “dengosas”, of the disease dengue, a mane which is generally known today. The English believe that the word dengue comes from the English word dandy, but this is not true because the disease was named by the people of Cádiz in 1867.      Some doctors have confirmed that the dengue has always existed but has never before revealed itself with such epidemic intensity or rapid development as it has recently. The journalist Gaberts confirmed that in Cairo in 1779 the dengue spread with the characteristics of an epidemic for the first time. The next year it appeared in Philadelphia where Dr. Rush studied the principle symptoms. In 1827 in South Asia and 1873 in China the dengue spread to all countries and paid no respect to race. Meaning, the disease spread with equal ease in one country as another. However, the greatest number of attacks were in Calcutta, Madras, Pondicherry, Bombay, and Cochinchina. The dengue is one of the most contagious diseases that exists. Although a pathological mibrobe has not yet been discovered, there is sufficient evidence to believe one exists.  The following are the characteristic symptoms of the disease. The average incubation period is four days. After, the disease attacks suddenly without any outward warning signs. An intense fever beings suddenly with intense joint pain and swelling of the extremities. A blotchy red skin rash will break out almost instantly. After two days the fever will decrease noticeably and the rash will reappear beginning the weakness and lack of appetite which the people of Cádiz call “dengosa”. Sometimes the disease lasts a week or even a month. Dengue causes almost no mortality. Of the 8,069 sick in India, only 47 died according to Dr. Martialis who added that they lived in the worst possible hygienic conditions. In Aden, only three of the 450 who were sick died. In Pondicherry none of the 227 sick died. According to Dr. Neilly many elderly people have died not from the dengue but from its effects on their organs, such as brain hemorrhages and pulmonary blockages. It can be said that the dengue causes for or five deaths for every 1,000 affected. It can be confirmed that the dengue is the fastest spreading epidemic. in 1872 there were 20,000 cases in a population of 30,000 in Saint-Déuis. In 1857 there 14,000 in Cádiz. In 1878, 1,900 of the 2,000 inhabitants of Ismaila were affected. In 1872 there were millions attacked. And finally, the Russian capital, which has known the disease for only several days, has already seen 150,000 cases.      Dr. Mary Durand recommends preparing salicylic acid and massaging sore joints to prevent the spread of the disease. Dr. Mahé has said its not unlikely that the disease will spread to Toulon and Marseille and from there to Spain. Prepare yourselves therefore, to become victims of dengue.    	Spanish		
16	The Times	St. Petersburg		London		1889-12-03T00:00:00Z		The outbreak of influenza which is reported from St. Petersburg, Moscow, Siberia, and many other parts of Russian territory, and which has caught within its toils members of the Imperial family, the English Ambassador, and our own Correspondent, points to the possible reopening in this and other countries, of a curious page of medical history. The name ‘influenza’ appears to have been first given to what is technically ‘epidemic catarrh,’ in Italy, in the course of outbreaks at Venice and Milan in 1741, and was a manifest survival of the superstitions which, four centuries earlier, attributed the Plague to the influenza of three great planets, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, entering into conjunction with Aquarius on the 24th of March 1345, of which still exist among ourselves in the currency of the word ‘lunacy,’ as a description of the condition of the insane. In other countries the frequent importation of the disease from Russia has caused it to be called ‘Russische katarrh’ in Germany, ‘Catarro Russo’ in Italy, and ‘Influencia Rusa’ in Spain, which in Russia itself it has been known as ‘Le catarrh Chinois,’ a term sufficiently explanatory of popular belief as to the country of its origin. Under one name or another it has been known in Europe as an epidemic since the middle of the thirteenth century, and it has prevailed in England on many occasions. Ten outbreaks are reported as having occurred in the eighteenth century, and four in the present century, in the years 1803, 1833, 1837, and 1847. The date of the last is sufficiently remote for the characteristics of the disease to be unknown, otherwise than by description, to the majority of the medical men now in practice; but, as far as can be ascertained from books, the chief symptoms have scarcely varied at different times. The epidemic of 1833, which almost immediately followed the first appearance of Asiatic cholera in England, was remarkable as having coincided with the commencement at a time in which the old practice of taking blood from the arm in a great variety of complaints began to lose ground in the estimation of observant men; and there seems little doubt that, from and after the period referred to, there occurred a more or less definite change in what has been called the type of disease, a change in which symptoms of depression of the powers of life were more conspicuous than symptoms of inflammation, and which afforded the largest measure of success to those practitioners who were careful to husband and sustain, rather than to depress, the vital energies of their patients. A very full and careful account of the metropolitan epidemic of 1847 has been preserved by the late Dr. Peacock, and in this epidemic, which commenced in November and was extremely fatal, the evidences of depression were universally conspicuous. The present system of registration of the causes of death, although not long introduced, and still hindered by many difficulties, was actually in operation; and, in the course of the six months during which the disease either prevailed or lingered, the deaths attributed to it in London amounted to 1,739, from which number it was estimated that about a quarter of a million of the inhabitants had been attacked. Moreover,  during the six weeks in which the epidemic was at its height, not less than 5,000 persons died, in the metropolitan districts, in excess of the ordinary mortality of the period, thus justifying the belief that many other ailments had been hastened to an unfavourable termination by the superaddition of influenza. The suggestion, however, which has been attributed to Professor Zdeckauer, to the effect that the epidemic now existing in Russia is probably premonitory of cholera in the spring, is one which appears to derive no support from either reason or experience. The two diseases are totally unlike one another, and probably the only recorded coincidence between them, even in point of time, is that, as already mentioned, influenza followed soon after cholera in the country in 1833. Apart from the depressing character of the disease, the most remarkable point in the history of influenza has been the rapidity with which each epidemic has invaded large areas of territory, and has attacked large numbers of people. The diffusion has usually been of such a kind as to preclude the probability of infection from person to person, and to suggest the operation of some general and widely diffused cause. It has been observed, moreover, that the epidemics have usually coincided with periods of increased prevalence of other disorders, such as the various forms of fever; but, unfortunately, at the date of the last prevalence, in 1847, the difference between these forms were not understood, and nothing was certainly known of the natural history or methods of diffusion of any of them. It may reasonably be hoped that the skill and experience which have been gained during recent years in tracing out the origin and modes of spreading of disease will come into play during the present outbreak, even if it should be confined to Russian soil; but the former history of the malady does not encourage the hope of any such limitation. If it should reach England, it will be curious to see whether the improved sanitary condition of the kingdom will differentiate the epidemic from those which have preceded it, and which, if contemporary descriptions of them may be trusted, have shown little dependence upon the conditions by which, in a general way, the public health is chiefly promoted or impaired. The late Dr. Theophilus Thompson, who edited a history of epidemic influenza for the Sydenham Society, says of the disease that ‘it exhibits, in the well-ordered mansions of modern days, phenomena similar to those which it presented in the time when rushes strewed the ground in the presence chamber of our monarchs and decaying animal and vegetable matter obstructed the porticoes of palaces.’ It may, perhaps, be doubted whether this assertion, in which something of complete accuracy may possibly be sacrificed to the felicitous turning of a sentence, will be confirmed by the more strict research of our time. It was published in 1852, and it is more than possible that the ‘well-ordered mansions’ of that date would fail to satisfy the sanitary tests which would be applied to them by a modern surveyor, and also that the spreading or the severity of the disease may be determined by conditions less coarse than, but equally deleterious with, the rushes and refuse of the historian. It has been abundantly shown, in the course of the last five-and-thirty years, that it is by no means impossible for a palace to conceal beneath its splendours conditions as insanitary as any which could be discovered in a hovel. As far as the information has at present reached us, the epidemic in Russia, although of very general diffusion, is of comparatively moderate severity. An enormous proportion of the population of St. Petersburg is said to have been attacked, but mortality is hardly mentioned. In this respect, at least, the outbreak bears favourable comparison with almost all preceding ones of which records have been preserved; and, if the malady is destined to run its usual course, and to traverse Europe generally, it may be hoped that its character of mildness may be preserved. In the interests of science, its arrest in Russia would possibly be a misfortune; for, if it should reach more scientific countries, it will certainly be subject to a more searching examination than is otherwise at all probable. We can hardly fancy an occupation more congenial to the mind of M. Pasteur, for example, than that of microbe hunting among the subjects of influenza; and the facts with which we are acquainted point with great probability to success in such an enterprise. In former times and in other countries, it has been observed that much illness among the lower animals has co-existed with influenza among mankind; and the part which may possibly be played by milk in the distribution of the poison is a question which seems to call for careful inquiry. To the scientific pathologist, indeed, the reappearance of a disease which has not visited this country for forty-two years would be a matter of the most lively interest, calculated to excite in him emotions parallel to those with which a sportsman would engage in the pursuit of some previously unknown game, or an archaeologist, before mummies were vulgarized, in the task of unrolling one. If we come to more practical considerations, we may remind our readers that diseases, however puzzling may be the conditions of their incidence, are not mysteries, but simply matters which we do not understand, because we have failed to study and observe the phenomena with sufficient care. In the absence of specific knowledge about the immediate cause of influenza, there is no doubt as to our possession of many sound generalities which we may usefully apply for our protection. Influenza is an epidemic catarrh, and there is much to e said in favour of the common belief that all catarrhal maladies are liable to be produced, or at least aggravated, by the effect of cold upon the surface of the body. This knowledge points to the use of plenty of underclothing, which affords warmth without undue weight, as well as to the desirableness of breathing through the nostrils, so that the air may be warmed and filtered in their winding passages before it is suffered to enter the chest. Many an old gentleman has contracted his last bronchitis from standing at a street-corner, in inclement weather, to talk and laugh with a friend, thus filling his lungs with volumes of cold and dirty air drawn directly through the widely opened mouth into the respiratory passages. These are among the simple matters concerning which few people learn wisdom until it is too late, and which yet appear almost too obvious to justify the occupation of time in talking about them. Another fertile source of liability to disease, even in ‘well-ordered mansions’ is the frequent stuffiness of the dwelling rooms, or the absence of any proper care that the air contained in them shall be renewed with a frequency proportionate to the number of occupants who require to breathe it. If people will lead rational lives, they may not, indeed, be able to bid defiance to an epidemic the channels of diffusion of which are as yet unknown to us; but they will certainly keep themselves in the best position for resisting its onslaught, or for minimizing the consequences of its occurrences.

That which in recent weeks telegrams have repeatedly mentioned as Dengue fever, as we quoted from the Journal of Geneva, doesn't belong to the murderous epidemics, but rather may be compared to a high grade influenza.  The symptoms are listed as chills, fever, headache, and great fatigue of the mind and body. That Dengue fever originates in the Orient, like so many other terrible guests, it appears in Russia since the year 57, and is also infamous in America and England as the "bone breaker" and has left pleasant memories  nowhere.  According to the newest reports, more members of the Russian royal family are ill with this currently raging fever.  The doctors fear that this epidemic could be a precursor of the currently raging cholera in Persia; it is associated with skin rashes and strong muscle contractions.

22	Philadelphia Inquirer	St. Petersburg		Philadelphia		1889-12-08T00:00:00Z		Cholera in Its Wake. The Disease Likely to Break Through into Europe. The Czar Ill. Special Cable to the Inquirer. London, Dec. 7.—It is more significant that this epidemic of influenza has generally been followed closely by a cholera wave, and though the British Medical Journal this week devotes a long leader to discrediting the possibility of any relation between the two, popular belief in the idea is firmly rooted. There certainly is cholera now in Persia and if it finds its way through South Russia into Europe next spring, nobody would be surprised. The present disease is, however, more irritating than dangerous Even in 1834, when it attained its most virulent form, the mortality was only 2 percent. This year a much smaller percentage of deaths is reported, but the contagion is spreading with unparalleled swiftness. The Czar himself has been ill with it a whole week and the British Legation at St. Petersburg are all down with it. The symptoms begin with headache, an acute chill developing into a high fever lasting several days and then a fortnight of great lassitude. Death intervenes only when plumonary [sic] oldema is superadded in cases of weakness. It is generally confined to the old and the very young. But the most prominent effect is to render the whole community and nation depressed and surly. Perhaps this is the reason why the St. Petersburg papers have suddenly raised a phenomenal cry about Austria’s having allowed the Bulgarian loan to be officially quoted on the Vienna and Perth exchanges.

The doctor, Zdekauer, one of the most prestigious doctors in St. Petersburg, explained his opinion about the epidemic in the following sentences; “The flu by itself is not a dangerous sickness; but due to special circumstances, we need to pay specific attention on this epidemic. Since I’ve been a doctor, cholera has invaded Russia four times, and those four invasions were preceded by the flu; one should fear that today’s epidemic is the precursor of another cholera invasion from Asia, and especially from Persia. The fear is that the flu microbe, after surviving the winter, will convert into the cholera microbe, or degenerate into it, giving me reason to think that next Spring, this will be of the biggest urgency to the sanitation department in St. Petersburg. The experiences from 1830, 1848, 1866 and 1884 when cholera was present has taught us that quarantines and sanitary cordons are not effective.

The main focus points of the disease are the warehouses of the Louvre where 400 employees have been attacked by the disease and the central Post Administration where there are 200 sick.          The influenza has spread in the city of the Seine in shuch a way that there are causes of the disease in the neighborhoods most distant from the Louvre and the central Post Administration.          The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of the disease known as grippe.          Dr. Holland says that influenza develops in all seasons, crosses the world for an entire month, sometimes with a determined direction, and invades certain nearby localities at the same time with different intensities. Atmospheric changes do not affect the disease and sometimes it remains stationed in one locality without spreading to the surrounding areas.          Dr. Holland finished by saying that due to the nature of the disease its spread can only be attributed to atmospheric vicissitude.          The influenza presents suddenly and begins with violent fevers, red blotchy skin rashes, and general prostration in the infirm. The disease causes almost no mortality, but the mortality caused is generally among the elder who suffer extreme cases.          In Paris a Commission of doctors has been named to inform the public about the epidemic. The warehouses of the Louvre have suffered great losses, but no one has dare to visit since the day the news broke that 400 were affected there.          The London newspaper Standard affirms that the influenza has always preceded cholera; but the majority of doctors say that it is not guaranteed that this epidemic predestimes a choleric outbreak because cholera has a specific cause which needs intervention for the disease to spread.

That it is ridiculous, however, does not make it less grievous or less serious. In Russia and in France its ravages are extensive and alarming, and a journal of Berlin feels called upon solemnly to deny that it has yet appeared in an epidemic form in that capital. It is as inexplicable as the ‘epizootic’ of a few years ago, and the symptoms in each case appear to be similar. The business and life of a whole community may be suspended for a time if enough of its inhabitants are simultaneously stricken with hay fever. These seems to be nothing worse in the epidemic influenza than people with hyper-sensitive mucous membranes undergo every Summer. This means discomfort often amounting to acute distress and to temporary disability, but it is not dangerous, and there is very little fear that it will become chronic.

In certain London neighborhoods there have been various cases: in Copenhagen, Cracovia, and Lemberg, part of the garrisons are affected, and in Vienna there have been 13 cases just in the General Hospital.          In the capital of the empire, Moscow, the epidemic has noticeably diminished in the last few days, without a doubt due to the influence of the weather. Although the cold has been so intense that the Neva and the canals are frozen.         In Paris, the influenza is spreading rapidly. In the Louvre warehouses the number of affected, which was 400, has risen to 600 in one day. In the Grenell neighborhoods, the markets, and the Central School, there are a considerable number of cases.          The doctors named by the Paris prefect to rule about the character of the disease have stated that the disease has existed in Paris for some time, but has been developing in an extraordinary manner since November 26th.          The doctors added in their report that the disease is a grippe whose duration does not exist more than four days and that it causes almost no mortality. For those reasons they do not believe it is necessary to adopt preventative measures.          Anywhere where there is a mass of people, the effects of the influenza have been felt.          It has spread rapidly in Germany and Sweden.          In Málaga, according to a newspaper, there are 60 people in bed with a disease that present very strange symptoms. They feel great discomfort and unless there has been a serious error, they cannot leave bed.          The Ministry of Governance has given the order to Mr. Aguilera to find a location to accommodate the sick should the influenza be felt in Spain. In yesterday’s session of the provincial council, the need to prepare a location to collect the necessary supplies if the influenza spreads in Spain with the same rapidity it did in Paris was discussed.          A doctor in London has declared that the fever called grippe or influenza has existed in Bedford Park for two weeks.          The most recent influenza spread in England in 1849.          This disease is considered by English medical authorities to be the most contagious that exists but it not believed, as reported by a London newspaper, to precede an epidemic of cholera.          La Agencia Fabra communicated to us the following telegram, which gives that the Princess Eulalia has been attacked by the disease in the capital of the Republican neighborhood.          PARIS 12--The Newspaper Le Gaulois announced this morning that the Princess Eulalia is afflicted with the epidemic known here by the grippe, dengue, or influenza, the one which has spread through all of northern and central Europe.          It adds that the Princess’s illness does not show any severity, but she has been obligated to postpone her departure for Madrid.          PARIS 12--The dengue or influenza dominant in Germany is generally more benign than that in Russia.          The same can be said in respect to Paris.

Here are their words: “It will be best if the epidemic does not come, but if it does come, it is advisable to treat it like a benign fever, a common cold or something of the like (what our elders call flu or grippe) and not let it put fear in our spirits.  “Older and more danger diseases regularly plague us; and nevertheless, we go along.” This cannot be held in doubt.  Anyone who has suffered from “toditis” has no reason to fear the influenza.  But to those who are healthy… To those who never have to see the diseases of fusionist government… Those care that the influenza does not reach us. 	Spanish

In Russia there are fewer cases in the capital, but the disease has invaded the provinces with an extraordinary force. In Dantzig, Spandau, Copenhagen, and other locations, primarily the Prussian provinces, the influenza has increased in frequency and intensity. The London newspaper, The Standard, said that in Stockholm in the two days since the existence of the disease was declared, there are already 2,000 cases and that in London the disease is spreading with extraordinary rapidity.  Paris is where the dengue, grippe, or influenza has demonstrated the height of its growth. In addition to the extraordinary number of cases that exist in the Louvre warehouses, Saint Louis Secondary School, and Saint Cyr Military School, there are 1,760 cases in the Polytechnic School. In the neighborhoods of the left bank of the Seine and those adjoining the forests of Vincennes and Bologna the cases are numbered in the thousands.  Dr. Cyon, from the Paris Academy of Medicine, said that the symptoms he has observed in those affected by the dengue are an intense fever, headaches, general laxity, and intermittent red skin rashes, He expressed that the first cases of this epidemic have presented themselves where there is a great concentration of people, as has happened in St. Petersburg, Berlin, and Vienna.  He said the disease is not severe and that those alarming telegrams published by The Standard referring to the particular case of Mr. Lasky, director of the international bank, were exaggerated. Mr. Lasky suffered from a chronic illness that was only aggravated by the dengue.  Dr. Cyon believes that the disease is spread by respiratory mucus. He advises breathing boric acid and borax through the nose and throat as a means of prevention.  He advises a solution of four parts boric acid per 100 to breath through the nose and a solution saturated with borax to breath through the throat.  He assures that everyone who used these medical solutions in the Russian capital were freed from the contagion.  In their statement, the Russian Society of Hygiene was in agreement with Dr. Cyon and attributed the spread of the disease to the constant changes in temperature.  Dr. Proust says that the disease reigning in Paris is a very weak and benign grippe and he believes that it will probably vanish soon.  Dr. Proust rejected the rumor that the dengue was imported to Paris by some tapestries from the orient that were destined for the Louvre, believing it to be completely erroneous.  The symptoms of the disease as observed by Dr. Crettardel and Dr. Proust are identical to those Dr. Cyon said are characteristic of the dengue.  In Paris some schools have been ordered to shut down and the students sent home in order to avoid that the concentration of people will cause the disease to spread more rapidly.  A newspaper from Malaga said the disease presented itself there.  Several medical authorities, contrary to that reported by The Standard, said that the dengue is not always a precursor to cholera. Sometimes the disease has developed afterwards or at the same time which caused the victims to be the terrible host of the bank of the Ganges.  	Spanish

The news that we receive from the infected areas, in context, are enough to relieve the spirits of those unfamiliar with the disease. It can be treated like a strain of catarrh that only has alarming effects in those that suffer damaged lungs or ar very feeble.          The elderly already know this if it is the “influenza” coming, it will not be the first time. Back in the year 1836 or 1837 we had in SPain a season of the same influenza as is described in this article, which was also repeated in 1848.  We have said that the “influenza” which many call “grippe” or crudely “flu” in the periods cited is a strain of catarrh and we add, that its less than catarrh because catarrh commonly turns into pneumonia and “influenza” does not. Everything can be reduced to a cold and general discomfort that lasts a short time.  When it visited us the first time, they invented many pills and cough syrups with no effects other than to upset the stomach. We only remember the positive effects of one pill, made of balsamic substances. The formula has been saved and is as follows: A pinch of benzion, a pinch of incense, a pinch of licorice extract, six balsam seeds, and a pinch of opium extract.  [this is a very rough translation--consult Dr. Venkatesh] Mix the ingredients and it will yield 48 pills.  This medicine is just as useful for the cough of “influenza” as for that of catarrh. But it should not be used until one illness or the other has begun, not when all is well, and the principal symptom it treats is cough.  it is taken for the ordinary catarrh once per day, at night in bed, at least three hours after the last meal. Adults take two pills, children only one, drinking at the same time a cup of chamomile or tonic water.  In terms of  “influenza,” the doctor can say, according to the case, how many doses to take and or how many days the treatment can be repeated.  With the sole hope of helping, we have printed this information; but because we are not medical professionals and only speak from experience, we subject ourselves to the enlightened advice of doctors.

The reports recognize December 10th by the Le Temps in the Dirección of the Louvre and between the same employees, resulting that some were sick, but did not have any character determining the epidemic.  Every year in this era, in the preparations for Christmas work increased, noted there is more sick staff than ordinary, but must recognize that the proportion has never been greater than now.  The doctor of the establishment attributes this state of things to excess tiredness and the subtle change of temperature.  He doubts the character of epidemic of the sickness, the patients do not present the same symptoms; some has a slight fever, others constipation, and many after two or three days of rest, returned to their normal occupations.  “These days it is said from various employees that excess work has produced some constipation, headaches, excessive fevers, according to temperatures and predispositions of each. The distribution of the locals of the Louver gives a violent flow of air, that should cause the indisposition of our partners, and it is noteworthy that the section of silks, one that is more exposed to the currents, has also had more attacks, and of 60 employees a third are absent. Besides the ill there are the discontent, that have the precontext that the cause of the indisposed of the ailment have in the dining hall, the equal is not admissible, because the first cashier, the second and the boss of advertisement ate out and have also been attacked.” These declarations, continues Le Temps, match with those in the Dirreción.  “We adopted our stores, said M. Rousseau, all of the precautions advised by hygiene; so is that following medical opinion, we boil the water of the Seine and throw a lot of lettuce and endive for personal ailment because because it has been bought at the market, and they water of the Seine can be contaminated. Therefore we are able to assure than an epidemic does not exist in our stores. There is a flu epidemic and constipations that winter brought to Paris, and that attacks our employees, as well as attacks all the inhabitants of the population.” The staff of the central Mail and Telegraph Administration of Grenelle Street has been attacked by a pain that has much in common with the Louvre.  The company has a staff of 550 men and 429 women.  Until the 5th of December there was no note of anything out of the ordinary in the services, and only 20 employees suffered slight indispositions, but of the 6th and 7th, the number of absent between 520 men rose to 40: by the 8th it was 60, and by the 10th it was 80.  The ill feel a general tiredness, and in their face appears red spots, also, they complain of headaches and a high fever.  The doctor of the Mail Administration was not able to give anyone a precise diagnosis, and clarified these indispositions as fever or flu.  In the female staff there are 50 absences.  The impressions of the doctors is that the indispositions presented are the same as the flu; but that all the cases have a benign character.  In this epidemic they are not able to recognize the cause of the ailment,  because the employees of the Mail ate in their homes, and few were able attribute the bad conditions of work, because the Mail center is in a completely new building, and the wards where the employees work have high elevation and are well ventilated, and have been arranged in accordance with the latest hygienic developments.    In Vienna The flu has appeared in the capital of Austria; but has not yet taking epidemic character.  However, from last friday many cases have occurred.  The authorities and doctors have adopted a type of medicine to reduce the contagion.  They hope the sickness will not be as violent as in Russia, and the cases present are not mortal, the attacks alleviating after four or five days of fever and headaches In Cracovia and Lenberg there are many cases, especially in the garrison. The troops of the garrison in Vienna still are not sick.   In London  A famous doctor in London has declared to a reporter that for two weeks two mysterious cases in Bedford Park occured.  The last flu epidemic that appeared in England was in 1849.  This sickness, considered by various doctors as contagion, spreads where health conditions decline.

Sysmptoms include intense fever, fatigure, head pain, and red spots/splotches on the face. There are clusters in major cities, specifically St. Petersburg, Vienna, and Berlin. The sickness was first detected in large hotels and in tramways. As of now it is not gravely serious, and usually lasts 5-6 days. Soem of the warnings coming from St. Petersburg seemed to be exaggerated.

A man wakes up in the morning with a nose six times its normal size, inflamed eyes streaming with tears, and bronchial tubes all choked up. The disease started in Russia, where it demoralized business, scattered the court nobles, and reduced the czar to a state of imbecile wheeze. Then it pulled old Bismarck, and set all the soldiers on the continent to sneezing. There will be neither war nor business nor fun while this thing lasts. It is spreading, and may reach this country. In its mild form it winds up in four days but its victims would rather die than go through it. The international snuffles is the latest name for it. Will it come this way?

Europe Having Them Now, and America Must Have Them Later. That Fashionable Influenza Will Surely Cross the Sea. But Our Doctors Scoff the Idea that It’s Cholera’s Precursor. Prepare to sneeze! Paris has set the fashions for the civilized world for half a century or more, and Paris is sneezing. The gay French capital has been sneezing for three weeks, while Berlin and Vienna, not to be out of the fashion, which is declared to being out of the world, are wrinkling up their noses and “A-a-chewing” like all possessed. All England hastens to adopt the new fashion, and with the return of the American tourist New York will as surely take on the new fancy and sneeze with unanimous accord. Europe has an epidemic of influenza. It began at Paris and spread over the Continent, and is at this moment making its way across the briny deep. Dr. Louis A. Sayre says so. Dr. George F. Shrady says so, and the Health Department says so. Indeed, a number of physicians go so far as to say that the avant-courier of the epidemic is already here. But do not be frightened. All agree that this latest fad is not dangerous to life—only annoyingly disagreeable to him who has it and excruciatingly funny to him who has it not. The first symptom is a sneeze Then the nostrils feel dry. There will be a tightness of the chest. You will cough a dry cough and your throat will be sore. Then you will wonder if life is really worth the bother of living, your spirits will go down, your ambition will ooze out at the ends of your fingers and a languor will possess you. You will not care whether school keeps or not for about ten days, and then you will brace up, and in another week you will be able to laugh at your neighbor, who is just beginning to sneeze his head off. Dr. Sayre recalls that in 1843, while John Tyler was President, the country was visited with an epidemic of influenza and it was called the ‘Tyler Grip.’ Everybody had it, and Dr. Sayre, who was a young practitioner in St. John’s Park, than a most fashionable quarter, recalls that no less than seven old physicians of the Square were down with the ‘grip’ all at once, and each, unknown to either of the others, dropped a note to the young physician asking him to kindly look after the writer’s patients during his illness. Everybody in town had it and then it went all over the country. Old and weak people suffered much, while young and strong persons got off with a light sentence. The epizootic of 1872, which began with the horses and after many weeks extended to persons, was more severe, and hundreds of thousands of people were suffering at once with the epizooty. Men, women, and children were seized. They sneezed, coughed, and felt miserable and debilitated, sore, and disconsolate. Dr. Shrady recalls epidemics of influenza in 1847 and 1866, each time followed by cholera, but he says: ‘That was a coincidence, I think. I do not think there was any connection between the two, and I apprehend no trouble to New York from cholera now. The city is too well fortified against cholera.’ Physicians generally scout [sic] the idea that the natural result of an epidemic of influenza would be an increase of deaths from small-pox, diphtheria, cholera, typhoid-fever, &c., and all agree that the coming epidemic will not be all dangerous to life, though feeble and aged persons will suffer from it, as it debilitates and makes weak, leaving the patient without appetite and spiritless. There is no increase of temperature or other serious symptoms, and the person afflicted with this influenza will not be excused from attending to his usual business duties. The Health Department is looking for the coming epidemic, but there will be no quarantine against it. It will come in the cabin as well as the steerage, ad will revel in Fifth avenue and disport in the tenement house district. There is no way to stave it off, and everybody must take his chances.			
56	Boston Evening Journal	New York City		Boston		1889-12-13T00:00:00Z		The European Influenza Has Arrived in This Country. New York, Dec. 13. A morning paper says that the epidemic of influenza, which is now raging in Paris and other cities of Europe, is expected in New York soon. In fact, many prominent physicians intimate that the advance guard is already here, but none of them is willing to become personally responsible for this assertion. They all agree, however, that there is an unusual number of colds in the head, even for this season of the year. A reporter obtained the views of a number of physicians yesterday, all of whom agree that the epidemic will probably soon be well underway here, and they are equally unanimous in the assurance that it is not a dangerous malady, although very unpleasant and totally impartial in its attacks, afflicting rich and poor alike, but proving less serious to young and health people than to the old and debilitated.			
57	St Louis Post-Dispatch	St. Louis		St. Louis		1889-12-13T00:00:00Z		An Epidemic Wave. The Foreign Influenza Scourge Coming Across the Atlantic. Opinions of S. Louis Physicians. A reporter of the Post-Dispatch called on a few of the prominent throat specialists of St. Louis this morning to obtain their views on the disease. Dr. J. C. Mulhall remarked: ‘I do not know whether it will come to this country, nor do I see how these New York physicians can tell. Influenza is to the human race what epizootic is to the horse, only it is not so deadly. It does however, sometimes produce death and its seriousness depends largely on the constitution of the person attacked. Old, feeble people, or young babies, who are not strong, or people of weak constitutions are apt to die with it, but with strong, robust people it is not a serious complaint. Then, of course, it may produce bronchitis or pneumonia, and they in turn produce death. It is not, however, considered at all serious like cholera or small-pox, and an epidemic of it should not cause any very great alarm. It is believed to be a germ disease, arising from atmospheric conditions. The atmospheric wave containing the germs may come to this country or may go to Australia. We do not know what course it will take. We know pretty well now the course taken by the cholera atmospheric waves, but know nothing as yet concerning the influenza waves, and we will probably have to have eight or nine more epidemics of the complaint before we will be able to map out its movements. For this reason I cannot see why anybody can tell whether it will visit this country. We know that attempts have been made to inoculate influenza from one person to another and have proved failures, so that it is doubtful whether our people coming to this country from Europe could bring the disease with them. If there is not an atmospheric wave containing the germs of the complaint why is not all Europe affected by the epidemic instead of only a certain belt? Surely there is enough inter-communication between these countries. I have not seen anything at all in the medical journals about the epidemic in Europe and do not know how serious it is, or what the exact nature of the complaint is, for these epidemics come in different form. Influenza, while not considered a dangerous disease, is very disagreeable. It affects people something like the hay fever. Their eyes water, they cough, and sneeze and sort of choke up.’ Dr. Otto E. Forster expressed himself on the matter as follows: ‘There is not sufficient known about influenza to enable anyone to predict with any degree of certainty that this country will be afflicted with an epidemic of it. It is supposed to be produced by certain atmospheric conditions, but just what those conditions are we do not know. Unless this country becomes affected with these atmospheric conditions we will have no influenza here. It may come, however, but I hardly think that it would do any good to quarantine ocean steamers from Europe, even if the complaint was serious enough to warrant it, which it is not. While I do not know such to be the case, I do not think people can catch influenza by coming in contact with others who have it. In my opinion, the conditions which produce the trouble must be in the air. It is different from small-pox and yellow fever in this respect, according to my belief. Influenza is really a severe cold, but it is rarely known to produce death, so that nothing is to be feared from an epidemic. It is very annoying but that is all. Of course it may carry off some old and feeble people, or those who have weak constitutions, but people of good constitution have nothing to fear.’ Dr. William Porter was also called upon for his opinion of the disease becoming epidemic here: ‘I don’t even know that influenza is really epidemic in Europe. I have seen no accounts of it. Even if it is, I doubt very much whether it will visit this country, and do not know how anybody else can tell whether it is coming. At any rate, if it does come, the physicians, aided by the common sense of the people, will be able to take care of it. There is nothing in it about which to be alarmed. It is not considered a serious complaint, although it occasionally produces death among feeble people.’ Another prominent throat specialist remarked: ‘Influenza is really nothing more than a very bad cold in the head extending down in the bronchial tubes. It is dependent on atmospheric conditions, but just what these conditions are we do not know. I think that we are very likely to have an influenza epidemic here, as the communication between the United States and Europe is very close. Although not considered a dangerous disease it is nevertheless a very serious ailment and is apt to produce deaths among weak people, although strong people have nothing to fear from it. Then it may cause bronchitis or pneumonia, and thus in an indirect way produce death. Influenza is certainly a very prostrating disease. It is an historical fact that in the latter part of the last century during the Napoleonic wars the whole British fleet in the English Channel was floored by an epidemic of influenza. There were not enough hands left to man the vessels, and the fleet was so disabled by the ailment that if they had been attacked by the enemy they would have been unable to make any resistance. When influenza can floor strong, able-bodied sailors like that, you can imagine that it is pretty serious when it attacks old and feeble people.

Although it appears with benign character, it has developed and acquired in London, Vienna, Saint Petersburg, Paris, and Stockholm, called profoundly the attention of the authorities.  The telegrams from Saint Petersburg say that the sickness has left in some cases results of large lung inflammation, Mr. Jorki, director of the International Bank of Saint Petersburg, is in danger of death for this reason.  In this population descends the epidemic, motivated by atmospheric variations, the increase of cold has decreased the sickness.  In Copenhagen the epidemic appeared among the soldiers of the garrison.  In Vienna only 13 cases of the flu were recorded in the General Hospital. The sick are nine physicians y four wet nurses. They believe these cases are not of epidemic character.  In London, it is already present West of the capital, but until the date they are unsure of the number of attacks. In Stockholm, the Dutch have patients in the thousands.  In Paris it has taken a great increase, invading the market neighborhoods and the Grenche (?), many of the public officials, the central school and other educational institutions.  They also have benign character and has not registered any death, less than complicated with chronic conditions, or attack weak natures.  In the stores of the Louvre there are 3,000 employees and yesterday 670 were ill.  In the view of the famous Doctor Brouarjel y Doctor Proust, the employee’s sickness es the epidemic known as the flu. This shows extreme benignity and without the danger of death.  The sickness appeared yesterday in the central post offices.  A fifth of the employees are affected with the flu.  For this reason there was a special session held by the City Council. The council member Lepin questioned prefect of the police, asking the truth be told about the health of the city.  The prefect answered, reading the opinions of the Doctors Brouardel and Proust, which reassured the Council. The Louvre employees have begun to meet and mutiny, possessed by outrage by  believing that they are being neglected.  Administrators came calming them.  Several members also suffer from this epidemic (?) among them is Mr. Devello.  A newspaper of Magala said on the ninth more than sixty people were on bed rest, all well known in the population, some with cold and some with strange illnesses, with headaches (?) but without serious pain, they were unable to leave bed.  This lastest news is quite interesting and will not worry the public.

61	Freiburg Nachrichten	St. Petersburg		Freiburg		1889-12-14T00:00:00Z		Russia.  In the St. Petersburg the committee to protect the public health, the doctor to the Tsar held a talk about the influenza, in which he asserted, that the influenza is only the precursor to the cholera, which is imminent next spring. The bacteria of the influenza would overwinter until spring in Russia, in order to transform into Koch's bacteria (mycobacterium tuberculosis). At the end of his exciting talk, Dr. Zdekauer said: "God grant that I am mistaken." We actually hope, in addition the "St. Petersberg Newspaper" notes, that the good doctor is mistaken;  it would also not be the first time. We also hope that other doctors can be heard on this matter, so as not to escalate the vexation of the public .The committee to protect the public health has incidentally introduced a specific commission to research the question. As the "St. Petersburg Weekly Medical Journal" has done, in the last three weeks, a third of the population may, if not half of the population, be afflicted with the influenza. The emergence of the influenza might  be brought about for a long time through the low water table.  In Krakow and Lviv many cases of influenza have also been detected. London doctors draw attention to the fact that in England in 1833 was afflicted by a similar plague,  which was thought at it's first appearance to be cholera as it went through England. Later in 1847, it took on in London a dangerous form; 1,789 immediate fatalities were ascribed to it and the total death rate during the time of the epidemic was 5000 people, one should assume that at least one other disease contriubted to this death rate.  It seems that person to person transplantation of this catarrh like contagion is excluded, rather that the disease spreads in some other way. In western Europe it is known by the name "Russian Catarrh" and in Russia by the name "Chinese Catarrh."  According to new reports the influenza should have already occured in Krakow, Vienna, Berlin, and even in England.  Also in the large Louvre warehouses in Paris a fever  epidemic should be ruling.

The reports recollected on the 10th by The Times in the Louvre Direction and among the employees, results that some are sick, but that no affection (?) did not reign of the certain epidemic character.  All years in this era, in the preparations for Christmas increasing the work, notes the greater number of sick staff than ordinary, but recognizes the proportion as it has never been so great as now.  The doctor of the establishment describes the state of things as excess fatigue and sudden temperature change.  What causes doubt about the nature of the disease is that the patients do not have the same symptoms; some have fevers, others constipation, and many, after two or three days of rest, returned to their usual occupations.  These days we have had several employees  that said overwork has produced some constipation and headaches, fever according to the temperaments and predispositions of each. The local distribution of the Louvre leads to violent currents of air, which must have been the cause of the ailments of our peers, and it is note worthy that the section of silks, one of the most exposed to the currents, has also been one of the most attacked, had 60 employees in it, a third part is absent.  Among the (?) there are malcontents, who pretext the the cause of their ailments as food taken in the factory, which is not permissible, because first cashier, the second, and the manager of the section eat out, who were also attacked.  These statements, continuing The Times, agree with us, have been made in the Dirrection.  We adopt in our stores, said M. Rousseau, all the precautions that hygiene recommends, so, following the opinion of my doctor, we mandate boiling water from the Siene and throw in a lot of endive and lettuce, destined to feed the staff, because the food bought at the central market could be contaminated by the water from the Seine. Referring to the epidemic, we can assure that it does not exist in our stores.  What we have is an epidemic of flu and constipation that winter has brought to Paris, which attacks our employees, as it can attack all the inhabitants of the population.   The administration staff of the Central Telegraphs and Post Office on Grenelle street has been attacked by a disease analogous to with that of the Louvre.   The staff includes 550 men and 420 women.  Until December 5th there was no note of mortality in these services, and only 20 employees suffered from lingering ailments, but by December 6th and 7th the number of men absent out of 550 suddenly rose to 40: on the 8th it was 70, and by the 10th it was 80. The patients feel generally tired, they have red spots on their faces appeared, they complain of severe headaches and have high fevers.   The doctor of the Post Office administration was not able to give anyone a precise diagnosis, and clarifying them feverish ailments, or flu.  There were 50 absences in the female staff.  Doctor’s impressions are that these ailments present similarities to the flu, but that all the cases have a very benign character.  This epidemic can not be recognized by these ailments, because the post office employees eat in their homes, and neither can [the epidemic] be attributed to the poor conditions of the premises, as the Central post office is in a brand new building, and the rooms where the employees work have ceilings, are well ventilated, and are arranged according to the latest advances in hygiene. In Vienna The flu appeared strongly in the capital of Austria, but has not taken a good epidemic characteristic. However, since last Friday, many cases have occurred.  The authorities and doctors take all measures to reduce the spread. It is expected that the illness is not as strong as in Russia, and the cases presented are not fatal, the attacks relieve after four or five days of fever and headaches.  In Krakow and Denberg (?) there are many cases, especially in the garrison. There are still many ill in the garrison troops to Vienna.  In London  A famous London doctor has declared to a reporter that two cases of mysterious sickness occurred in Bedford Park in two weeks.  The last flu epidemic appeared in England in 1849.  This disease, considered by several doctors as contagious, spreads where sanitary conditions are poor.

Henry Parville of the Journal of Debates says about the this epidemic:  “We must distinguish between bronchitis, grippe, or the influenza and dengue fever: the first is a local phlegmasia, cold pressed seasonal fruit. The grippe or influenza is a general, if not benign fever, complicated with pneumonia, which develops to an epidemic form with soft and damp weather. The dengue fever is in America, Persia, and Egypt, having entered Europe through Greece and Russia; a fever quickly erupts and is accompanied with joint pain, also complicated with pleurisy and pneumonia; recovery is long and painful; diagnosis can be confused with smallpox or scarlet fever.” The civil government did not have official news that Madrid recorded any case of influenza or dengue yesterday.  As for the case of the epidemic visiting Madrid, the minister of Public Works has put the industrial palace and the arts at the disposal of the civil governor, Mr. Aguilera, in company with provincial deputies Mr. Galvez Holguin and Mr. Pulido, who visited yesterday in order to thoroughly see if conditions met the challenge destined for the hospital.  Both the governor and the deputies agreed that the palace has the desired conditions and 400 beds will be installed very soon with the necessary service.  In the afternoon the president of the council and Mr. Galvez Holguin and Pulido held a meeting with Mr. Aguilera, attended by provincial Mr. Ronderos. Some slight work needs to be done on the part of the building destined to be the hospital.  It is said that in the days past Madrid had several cases of influenza, but the patients are better now.

Many schools (L'ecole polytechnique & lycee St. Louis specifically) have seen many concentrated cases. At the Louvre cases of influenza seem to have entered and left quickly as many employees are beginning to reuturn to their services after a few days of rest. From Thursday to Friday the numbers effected increased from 120 to 150.

In Paris, the disease is slowly decreasing in both prevalence and intensity.          The wife of the President of the neighboring Republic and those of ministers Tirard, Freycinet, Guyot, and Constans have been afflicted by the dengue as well as Mr. Freycinet.          The state of atmospheric humidity is favorable to the spread of the epidemic. But it a general opinion among Parisian doctors that the disease will disappear when the temperatures increase.          The dengue is spreading the most rapidly and with the most intensity in Berlin.          The newspapers are suggesting preventative measure to fight the disease. There have been innumerable cases in the universities, schools, and theaters.          Several doctors, SPanish and foreign, say that the dengue out not be confused with the grippe. The former is always a benign disease that does not cause mortality while the later, although sometimes benign, can at times have as many victims as cholera.          The hope is that the predictions of the Parisian doctors come true and the epidemic disappears as soon as the temperature rise. This has occurred in the city of the Neva, where the disease disappeared as soon as the ice began to melt.

It is Now in Full Swing Among the Population of Paris. What its Symptoms Are. Interviews with Some of the Supposed Learned French Physicians Regarding the Malady. Various Opinions Given. The Scourge in France. (Copyright 1889 by James Gordon Bennett). Paris, December 14. [New York Herald Cable. Special to The Bee] The changes in the weather have been simply frightful in twenty-four hours. The thermometer as risen 15 degrees and fallen 10 degrees. This morning was clear, warm, and bright. Members of the jockey clubs strolled slowly through the Rue Scribe in spring overcoats, smoking cigarettes. This afternoon everybody was muffled up in furs and we had a biting snow storm. This evening was cold and clammy, while a fog has settled upon us and everybody is coughing and sneezing. The influenza epidemic is in full swing. It has captured the military school of St. Cyr; it has attacked the corps de ballet at the opera; it has made a clean sweep through the great shops like the Louvre and Ben Marche; in fact, nothing since the Eifel tower has absorbed such public attention as this aggravating and mysterious malady that has swooped down upon us from Russia and today holds not less than 100,000 Parisians in its annoying but, happily, harmless clutches. The Herald correspondent went out today in pursuit of information regarding this curious malady, and two of the best-known specialist of France were interviewed. Dr. Albert Rodin of the Academie de Medicine expressed himself as follows: ‘This disease is known as influenza, or more commonly in French as la grippe. Five days ago I had my first case, and since then I have treated at least twenty patients. Unquestionably the epidemic will continue to spread, how far it is impossible to say. As to its cause medical science today is practically at a loss. We can, to be sure, tell the public that it is due to the ravages of an undiscovered microbe, but the public takes only indifferent interest in that fact. ‘Why such an epidemic should sweep across Europe one year and then remain unknown for a decade is beyond our power to explain. The theory has been advanced that the influenza is the forerunner of cholera, but I regard that as pure nonsense. It is true that several times in the present century an influenza epidemic has been closely followed by a visitation of the cholera. It is also true that several times in the same century there has been an epidemic of influenza with no cholera following, just as there have been epidemics of cholera with no influenza preceding.’  Dr. Villemin of the Academie de Medicine was next seen. It is he whose name has been of late years so prominently before the Parisian public in connection with measures designed to check the terribly spread of consumption in the metropolis and in the French army. He spoke of the new epidemic in the same cheerful way a dramatist would discuss a successful play. ‘It is almost too soon,’ he began, ‘to speak positively about the epidemic which seems to be breaking out in Paris. It is generally assumed to be what we have been accustomed to call la grippe, and yet in reading accounts which have come from St. Petersburg, I have been struck by the presence of one symptom not usually observed in that disease. I refer to the appearance of a red rash on the bodies of patients. Now, there is in Syria and other Eastern countries a very common fever known as la dengue, which is accompanied by the presence of such as rash as described. This fever has even reached westward as far as Constantinople, and I am disposed to believe that the St. Petersburg epidemic is nothing less than this Syrian la dengue’. ‘And are we, then, going to have this Syrian fever in Paris?’ ‘Oh, there is nothing to be alarmed about. La Dengue belong to the category of maladies like scarlatina, measles, etc., which cause very little trouble. They run their fixed course in a few days. The patient gets well or occasionally dies, and that’s the end of it.’ ‘Do you attach any importance to that epidemic of influenza, or whatever it is, as a precursor of cholera?’ ‘Not in the least. There is not the remotest connection between the two diseases. Both are contagious, to be sure, but cholera is so chiefly by infected water, while the microbes of this St. Petersburg epidemic spread through the air and get into the system through the lungs.’ ‘Then one is liable to catch this influenza merely by going into a room where some one who has it has been breathing?’ ‘Certainly, or even by breathing one of the influenza microbes in the street, in a café, at a theater, in a railway carriage—anywhere.’ ‘Then the whole population is sure to be down with influenza sooner or later?’ The doctor laughed and shrugged his shoulders. Dr. Coroil, one of the best known specialists are tuberculosis, and a member of the Academie de Medicine, said: ‘This epidemic in our midst and about which we have received such varied accounts from St. Petersburg is simply La Grippe, an epidemic, a contagious disease of slight importance. A person suffering from it need not ever call in a doctor. Let him remain indoors a few days and keep warm, or, if the case is severe, let him stay in bed and drink plenty of tissane [sic]. That will put him right in short order. Yes, undoubtedly the epidemic is caused by microbes breathed into the lungs, but as yet we have not been able to discover this microbe. To be more accurate, I should say that we have not yet succeeded in distinguishing the influenza microbe from a quantity of others which are always found in the expectorations of persons suffering from that disease. It is not generally known, but the fact that saliva of healthy persons contains ten or twenty different kinds of microbes, which are not only harmless but absolutely necessary to digestion. As soon, however, as the person becomes affected with any disease of a contagious nature the number of microbes in the various bodily secretions become considerably increased and what makes the task difficult is that what I may call good microbes and bad microbes become hopelessly mixed up and it takes us years of patient experimenting to separate and classify them. In my laboratory I could show you jars and jars filled with cultivated consumption microbes. It is not long since a Russian doctor discovered a whooping cough microbe and the cholera microbe, as you know, has been unquestionably recognized. One of these days some savant will single out of the mass of tadpole-like creatures the influenza microbe, and that will be a happy day for him.’”

This disease does not spread by contagion and is completely different from dengue.  The Board of Health agreed to a vote of thanks to the governor for his actions, finding them plausible and unanimously approve.  Grippe is more than a passing sickness, that depends almost completely on weather conditions, it should not take preventative measures and only by statistical analysis, the governor has ordered the sub delegates of medicine to give daily to the [grippe] invasions that occur in their districts. The poor patients that request to be assisted in the hospital of the Palace of Fine Arts, have also voted and agreed to thank the Minister of Public Works for the transfer of the building.

One ? report in Rome, from the Italian envoy in Teheran, states that in Bagdad, Batzra, Baschri, and Mohammera cholera cases have occurred lately. The danger of the spread of disease through a variety of points of the Ottoman empire is greater, as more than 40,000 Mahommaden (Musilms) pilgrims, who this year after they went on a pilgrimage in the Karbala places, in that area situated near Bagdad, will arrive soon back in their homelands. These Mahommaden pilgrims were always the main propagators of the cholera.          • In Paris are:  236 of the 1122 civil servants of the central telegraph office and 87 of the 253 the salaried telephone women sick from the influenza.         • The influenza, whose harmlessness was something happily expressed, was just something that swept through their homes, and will gladly waive any and all invitations to them. One would not play such a frivolous game with other diseases, but in which, so to speak, because of the more humorous character of the influenza, one can allow at most that sort of thing. It has gradually come into fashion, that one must formally be ashamed, when one is forced to confess in front of friends and acquaintances, that they have been spared so far from each bout. Only people, who are not able to keep in step with the times, hide their light irresponsibly, as under a basket, that they always speak of the catarrh, where others would at least say the grippe. He who, but from his nature tends to boast, who boasts already of the least questionable stages of the influenza, if only a sip of coffee has come unrightly into his throat.

No would anticipate today, that like in 1873, the influenza would spread in Zurich with the same severity, as is now reported there from the large cities. A correspondent of the "Land Carriers" said of the report of one of the oldest  eminent citizens:   That the epidemic appeared suddenly and spread quickly through Zurich; the existing cure, lime blossoms, was quickly sold out in the apothecaries. Apparently, the baths were badly harassed when, in an individual quarter, a daily bread shortage occurred. The plague often seems like a throat catarrh with a fierce burning. It seems that despite this, a dangerous aftermath seems to only happen for the weak or physically sick, such as how they suddenly degenerate into typhus. It may remind elderly people of many tragic-comedy situations, such as the following: They are making repairs in a high school building. The master and a professor find themselves in a room, when  the latter suddenly declares, he is no longer able to lift the drawers because of weakness. The answer, of the yet powerful craftsmen was, he is barely able, to manage to carry away a piece of wood from the place. Incidentally Bogels Chronicle says, the sickness has rather fiercely resided in the Bülach district. In Zurich barely one in ten stays healthy.

Home of the Spanish Academy, surgical physician Dr. Jimeno and Cabañs announced their lecture of fear: “Some considerations of epidemiology for ‘dengue’ and ‘grippe’”.  After imploring the benevolence of the public, they alleged, among other reasons, his poor health, believing to be attacked with the same disease that was treated, trying above all to dispel the confusion that reigns, not only between the science of healthy, but also among physicians, about the conditions of the dengue and grippe… (Page 2 Column 5 paragraph 13) The grippe, he said, spreads as quickly as the dengue, and the facility of ease is precisely what has caused the confusion between the two diseases, but the second [dengue] is always benign, causing no casualties, while the grippe is often severe and sometimes long lasting.  Besides this difference, which induces variations in the prognosis, there are many other differences between the two diseases.  The girppe does not appear subtly, there is a prodromal period that feels a great gloom, or rather a general flattening, presenting fever accompanied by cold symptoms that do not exist in dengue, and violent frontal headache due to sinus colds; the fever is irregular, not typical and characteristic like dengue.  The character of the grippe are some nervous symptoms, moral gloom, exaltations of general sensibility and the sense organs anesthetics, etc.  The treatment of grippe, both prophylactic and curative, say that unfortunately, no hygiene or therapeutics, have means to prevent the disease or cure it, the doctor is restricted in the alleviation of symptoms when not enclose in full expectation.  (Page 3)  Then entered other considerations about epidemics in general and causes to obey, and after observing some, but not all, are limited in geographic boundaries, that other saved to extend throughout the world, laid the claim that all [epidemics] were recognized by origin of a living cause, a microbial agent; and looking at the analogy with parasitic diseases, whose geographic areas can be accurately drawn over a map, deduced that the same should and does occur with epidemic and infectious diseases.  He denied that ordinary atmospheric conditions, varying more or less, were capable of producing this kind of disease.  Are they- he asked- equal weather conditions of Madrid that existed in Saint Petersburg two weeks ago, when the grippe appeared there?  Here, this test called vulagísima (?), deduced the cause of this affection is, or should be, a microbe, and like all similar diseases has a defined cycle to travel, the doctor is unable to stop its evolution by any means.  Dr. Jimeo ended his conference with some other considerations about the importance of vaccines and the future of health, being applauded by the audience that occupied the precises.

The epidemic reigns and produces 20,000 victims in Madrid. The reign of the epidemic, is brief but devastating. The civil government has invaded almost all of its employees, except Mr. Aguilera.  The female telephone operators have extended an important tribute to the sensitive disease: half of them had to be kept in bed and still work, many suffer from “trancazo” in its minimum and medium degrees. His voice, fresh and sound before, now seen through the evening apparatus, gives a good understanding of the muffling of the grippe, preventing their throats from vibrating, nice melodies before the source.   The active cigar factory also suffered a respectable number. 70 employees abandoned their jobs, principally those dedicated to manufacturing the cigarettes 0.25.  The Fabra telegraph agency has many victims, including the director Mr. Fabra.  In this branch of the telegraph service in the East is excruciating to the few employees that are in the position to work.  The company of the Royal Theater is seen as unable to perform many jobs it has in its project, to stop to lower casualties, mainly in the choral masses, the popular disease.  The president of Congress has seen obligated to exchange the soft fluffy chair by the bed (?); the secretaries Mr. Garcia and Castillo and Mr. Arjona are sick, and other two secretaries, Mr. Hernandez Prieta and Earl of Sattensoa who are partners of with those who got the previously mentioned disease. The head of congress is also ill and 27 dependent accompany him in the misfortune.  The Chamber of deputies has a disasterous track record that points toward “trancazos”.  The marquis of the Armijo valley and the council president are ill, and also the interior deputy of the government, Mr. Moret, Mr. Rodriguez Sampedro and Mr. Gomez (of Protasio).  The spouse and children of the minister are much improved.  Also Mr. Testor has been reset.  All of the newspaper offices and typesetters have marked the disease.  In Paris, there is fear the newspapers wil have to suspended publication: also they believe that the Chambers have suspended sessions, or a considerable number of senators and representatives are sick.  After having taking possession of Old Europe, the disease has appeared in the young American continent; In New York the trancazo has begun its damage.  It is not known if the great nation of the United States, where everything is in giant proportions, the disease behaves hundreds of people, no less than if it was an epidemic, rather than how it is here, with a gallantry that is not thankful, and put you a few days in bed.

Of course anyone who has had the sickness will agree it is much more graphic than the grippe and influenza.   We have all agreed that the epidemic is of a benign character; but it occurs in other capitals, in Berlin, for example, where it said for about a month,  where it has yet gone, and we agree it is heavier than lead, not to mention that those who passed are not free to have it again.  In Madrid if follows a course we do not know if natural or logical, but very unpleasant for patients, because they are in pain, and for others because they have to carry the work of the sick.  Yesterday Mr. Sagasta was in bed, and also got his wife and four servants sick.  Mr. Bercia, who was well, worsened this afternoon, and the Marquis of Vega Armijo, can not go out on the streets for three or four days.  The editors of most journals in Madrid have stayed in the square, and the newspapers were miraculously published.   In the provincial council of Madrid, they found that the reigning disease attacked about forty of the employees.  And the same happens in City Hall, where the majority of the heads of business are found ill. Yesterday 39 employees of the secretary missed [work]. In the direction of the local council there are 23 sick employees.   Five officials negotiated the address, and all but two of them from the direction of the Instruction.  In the office of the Ministry of Public Works everyone is sick and Mr. Cegama had to leave bed rest yesterday to pay his employees.  The considerable number of casualties from the telegraphs, is figured this far, approximating a hundred people, has forced the head of the center to propose closing to the CEO, at nine p.m. the branch stations, except in the East, with the objective that the staff routinely provides limited service for these courses to perform at the center.  If unfortunately the circumstances make it necessary, the direction of the Telegraphs, in the general interest of the service, is willing to take the necessary measures, even withdraw the telegraph staff of some ministries.  Mr. Cánovas of Castile had yesterday a decline in his condition, and Mr. Martes was forced to stay in bed, along with Mr. Romero Giron, Mr. Gonzales Fiori, and Mr. Romero Paz.  In order to have an idea of the extent of the epidemic is reaching, it suffices to say that it is not only noticed in the cafes, where attendance was lower than usual, but also noticed in transit and the streets, which are usually busier.

This is attributed, however, to the report that the microbes travel in paper money, and when the contagious paper has been freely circulated in the city, it is expected the disease will become epidemic. At the Peninsular bank nine of the employes were sick at one time. In the Preston National there are four cases. The entire staff of the First National has it, and there are two cases in the Merchants’ and Manufacturers’ Bank. The symptoms are different in nearly every case. In some it produces ‘an all-gone tired feeling,’ as one expresses it, while in others the lining of the nose, mouth and throat is affected; still others have a cough. Lameness is one of the general points in which it shows up strong.

The influenza has now spread throughout a considerable portion of Bern. In more schools, the classes are reduced by a third or a half; many teachers (male and female) are compelled to suspend their classes. Under these conditions, most schools are beginning the proper holidays 8 days earlier, meaning today, instead starting on New Years Eve, and lasting 14 days instead of 8. The children, who have not fallen ill themselves, are naturally having not having much fun. The illness plays very poorly with some businesses, who have to overcome the non-routine work of the festive season and now must often relinquish the support of more employees. The story may yet become especially palpable, because the postmasters and salaried employees, who certainly by virtue of their service can take care of themselves less than anyone, have duly resided under the illness from the beginning, should be incapable of fighting it off in larger numbers. It is therefore recommended, that one should take caution from now on, and accomplish as much as possible the task of packages and the like in morning and not be postpone to the evening hours, where the work of the post office personnel as such accumulates.

There are few families that do not have any sick individuals, and almost all have had various attacks by the reigning illness. They calculate that 50,000 are sick from the flu.  And this explains, not only the discouragement of the festivities in the home, but the absence of these patrols or crews, of Christmas Eve troublemakers who give “tin” to peaceful neighborhoods.  The only ones gaining are the local pharmacies, drugstores, and what is more sensible, the funeral homes, because  mortality has doubled and tripled that compared to normal days.

Most subjects are predisposed to rheumatic shrink, and those who perspire heavily because of the dryness and coldness of the air determines a rapid evaporation of moisture from the skin, at the expense of animal heat, determined an internal cooling, an efficient cause of the sickness.  This form can be referred to as rheumatic fever cold.  The most effective treatment of the acute manifestations of rheumatism, two grams of sodium salicylate a day: my patients have been completely cured, and without condolences to fourteen hours of start to take medicine and staying in bed and diet, but without taking diaphoretics or induce sweat. Antipyrine also causes rapid remission of the disease, but it is fleeting, it is left as fever reappeared; the advantage of the salicylate soda is that the decline produced is final.  The flu treated only by sudorific, prolongs several days, lets the sick suffer considerably then leaves convalescent.” -Dr. Valenzuela	Spanish	trancazo, grippe 	https://scholar.vt.edu/access/content/group/05ff0d36-d2c7-467b-8609-8c34c8044809/Images/Spanish%20Newspaper%20Images/Diario%20Oficial%20de%20avisos%20de%20Madrid%20Dec%2028.PNG

The dates published by the Gazette shows that the mortality caused by the sickness of the respiratory system is in proportion of 50 out of 100.  A colleague says this is because most cases confuse the debut of pneumonia with flu and neglect the cure, not taking the necessary precautions.  The doctors recommend to those suffering of the prevailing sickness to not neglect convalescence, because relapses are usually fatal.  As we said at first, the epidemic has been reproduced, innumerable patients suffer in its rigors. Among the guests included the newspaper director, Mr. Marin, and his family.  32 people are sick with the prevailing sickness of the employees of the Direction of the Duende.  In the Hall there are 115 sick cleaners, 200 watchmen, 4 visitors, 60 municipal guards, 60 administration employees, 32 in the secretary, and 10 in accounting.  480 in total.  The general secretary of the Hall, D. Rafael Sanaya, felt sick yesterday, realizing issues in the public office, had to withdraw and was replaced with Mr. Gargollo, senior official.  The grippe or flu continues to spread with extraordinary speed in the area.  In Barcelona, Mr. Maluquer and the President of the Provincial Deputation were found sick, the majority of the employees of the telegraph and telephone operators, so service is slow.  A multitude of establishments have closed their doors and have been invaded by all the employees.  The Lyceum Theater has found it necessary to suspend representations by lack of staff, because they are sick, as we read in the newspapers of the city, the following artists: Vand Zand, Allce del Bruno, Avelino Carrera and the Marchi Men, Tosetti and Visconti.  In such a situation that came to you through Rome, where our countrymen adjust, Fernando Valero and Mr. Bernis, businessmen here in the coliseum, strongly urge to stop some functions.

Commercial Association of Bern The Christmas celebration, which occurred Saturday evening in the large museum hall, may be said to have beem the most successful to ever have occurred. Genuine musical and song recitals alternated in a more suitable manner.  "A little orchestera", which this year instructed a ? musical artist, and has had quite excellent performances under the experienced management of Sir aug. Koch, found the most acclaim. An "amplified" orchestra brought "a bright sleigh party" recital, which gave great pleasure because of their originality. The "pleasure comittee" created with this "sleigh party", a good replacement for those members of parliment, which beacuse of the inevitable "influenza" had to be canceled. A resplendant Christmas tree radiated towards the numerous people present; two lovely daughters presented tickets for the raffle. Everyone offered pleasant conversation; for the entertaining evening, all participants were thankful to the commercial association,  and it will remain a pleasant memory for a long time.

127	St Louis Post-Dispatch	New York City		St. Louis		1889-12-14T00:00:00Z		Influenza in the Air. Symptoms of the Deadly Disease Already Visible in New York. (By telegraph to the Post-Dispatch). New York, Dec. 14. That the Health Department is not alarmed at the prospective epidemic of influenza is demonstrated by the fact that all the members of the board yesterday attended a meeting at headquarters in a room occupied by a clerk possessing all the symptoms as received by cable from Europe. His nose was inflamed, he indulged in a ‘dry, hard cough,’ he sneezed industriously, he appeared debilitated, and when asked what time the members of the Board of Health would arrive, he replied with due influenza accent: ‘Id is nod certaid whad tibe they will cub.’ And yet the Health Department, individually and collectively, denies that the epidemics has reached New York. That it is liable to reach here, however, is not denied, but, on the contrary, it is recognized as a probable visitor of the near future, but it is looked forward to as likely to afford interesting study combined with a degree of grim humor. ‘You cannot quarantine atmosphere, and as the influenza epidemic is in the air I don’t think we can head it off if it takes a notion to visit New York,’ said Dr. Wm. M. Smith, Health Officer of the port. ‘In fact, it is not certain that we are really threatened with the epidemic. I have seen no symptoms of it on any of the incoming European steamers, and it could not be imported in that way anyhow unless the atmospheric conditions were favorable. It is an infectious, not a contagious, diseases, and possesses local characteristics or preferences. While it prevails in an epidemic form in some parts of Europe, it has not made its appearance in others, and hence may not come here at all, or if it does, may assume a very mild form’			
129	Freiburg Nachrichten	Paris, Freiburg		Freiburg		1890-01-01T00:00:00Z		France.  The influenza continues to rage in Paris. It now often degenerates into tracheal and chest inflammation and the number of deaths is rising. It has also now invaded the barracks; therefore, during the holidays many leaves of absence  should be granted, only if the service permits them. Handel and Mandel are completely prostrate; only the Apothecary, which has partly raised their prices, is making good business. Some of the same have sold 1300 to 1800 Francs worth of drugs to fight the plague during the last week. It is obvious that under such circumstances, the Christmas festival was started without the old cheerfulness. Also the terrible rain did heavy discontinuation to Christmas Eve, which otherwise is normally  celebrated with much fun. Although the boulevards, on which the New Years Market takes place from the 24th of December to the first Sunday of the new year, were not laid To waste, but noticably fewer were busy than in usual years. Christmas and New Years booths did poor business. Meanwhile the festival, which Ms. Carnot organized on Christmas day for 400 poor children,took its usual course, even though the President of the Republic was kept away because of the influenza. The distribution of presents was started by a theatrical show, in which the so-called "Guignol", the buffon of the  puppet theater on the Elysian fields, plays the leading role. The children were beside themselves with joy, that Ms. Carnot distributed the presents herself, as far as her strength and time allowed. Another Christmas festival took place in the Hippodrom, where the Alsace-Lorraine children, around 8000 in number, were presented. The  festivities were brought here by the ladies Kestner, Floquet, and Dollsus, all three are descendents of von Goethe immortalized in Charlotte. The Christmas trees and the earth, in which they were planted, were brought from Alsace, and the lament for the  lost brothers and sisters sound exactly as it did in previous years.  Influenza. Over 250 school children and close to 300 adults are currently suffering in the city from the influenza. The schools were closed last Monday at noon.

The statistic today comes to no more than 34 deceased, a number that constitutes a very notable reduction in comparison to the numbers measured around the area last week. The postal service The postal service is becoming difficult, not only in Paris, but in the whole territory.  In several départements, the local management, distraught by the sickness of numerous officials and sub-officials, has received the order to appeal to the support of military authority to obtain reinforcements. In Paris, a fifth of mail personnel has defaulted from the service.  The sick mail carriers have been replaced by all available extra mail carriers.  But their number is insufficient to mitigate all of the absences. The officials and sub-officials are endeavoring, by a most commendable of zeals, to provide for the needs of the service during a period of the year when the number of postal communications is quintupled. A 100,000 franc gift The Municipal Committee has just been informed that the baron of Rothschild has given a sum of 100,000 francs to be distributed between the mayors of the 20 arrondissements, favoring the victims of the influenza. Outside Paris Outside Paris, new cases manifest a bit on all points. In Italy (From a correspondent) Rome, 30 December.  -- The influenza takes grand proportions, even though the administration is putting all its effort into hiding the progress of the malady. We highlight 400 cases of influenza in Spezzia and 1,000 in Catan. In Rouen The Journal of Rouen says that the influenza has been developing for 2 days in Rouen with a frightening speed.  One learns that the people with whom one spoke for several hours before were just confined to bed.  Everyone knows someone among their friends or acquaintances who is infected. In Havre The influenza epidemic pursues its course in the village of Havre in a growing manner, but nothing worrisome so far. Saturday, the Boys’ School of Apprenticeship had to be dismissed, a quarter of the enrolled students missing roll call.  In the Acacias, the Maternal School also had to be closed.  Many headmasters had to cease their service, notably the headmasters of the Amiral-Courbet Street schools and Places des Ecoles.  One noticed the absence of some sixty children on Frédéric-Bellanger Street. Finally, adds the Petit Havre, a large number of our fellow citizens are infected. In Evreux In Evreux, the epidemic has grown in intensity to the 6th Dragoon Regiment.  There are currently more than 100 sick there, and, the infirmary not being able to contain all of them, they had to compensate by adapting a squadron room for their special usage.  In the neighborhood of the 18th de Ligne regiment, the epidemic seems to be in decline.  There are hardly more than about thirty cases, instead of the 45 to 50 that there were some days ago. At the high school, the headmaster and the assistant headmaster, as well as some number of instructors and students being infected, they decided to move the New Year’s Day vacation forward by several hours.  The students were sent back to their families yesterday morning at 9:30. In Dunkerque The Lighthouse of Dunkerque says that the influenza is currently striking the village.  One lone pharmacist was called to check off remedies the day before yesterday for more than fifty people. In Saumur A newspaper from Saumur announces that the flu has made its appearance at the Cavalry School and that yesterday a large quantity of sick people introduced themselves during the visit.  The epidemic had been equally noticed in the civilian population. In Toulouse In Toulouse, where the weather was very humid and very unhealthy between December 18 and 24, many cases were reported everywhere where there is urban conglomeration, in the administrative and municipal services, and finally at the Veterinary School, where the students were dismissed yesterday and the personnel sent on vacation. In Lyon In Lyon, according to the Lyon-Medical, the number of deceased has risen to 220 this week.  In the same week in 1888, they had only registered 174 deceased. In Grenoble Grenoble is paying its tribute to the reigning epidemic.  The cases are as numerous in the regiments and among the population but they are generally benign.  In the primary and secondary schools, there is nothing extraordinary to report.  The mortality is the same as it is at this time of year. Since last night the snow fell in abundance; the ground is already covered in a layer of thirty centimeters. In Ajaccio Cases of “influenza” have been reported these last few days in our town.  Some number of military personnel in the garrison are in treatment at the hospital.  The malady has no grave character. In Alsace-Lorraine (From a correspondent) Met, December 30.  -- The influenza hits the Metz garrison hard. The 38th and 130th infantry are particularly affected.  The military hospital is packed.  They are arranging special chambers in the barracks to receive the sick. In Spain (From a correspondent) Madrid, December 30. -- From December 21 to 26, there were 41 deceased in the capital by respiratory illnesses. The Queen Regent, somewhat seriously affected, is obliged to stay in her room. 		Paris Deaths

In Saint Sebastian the dengue continues to spread.  Several guards and watchmen have been dismissed for that reason.  Same with the tram staff.  In Barcelona, by incentive of the bishop, temporary hospitals will be made, as Santa Cruz can not fit all the people growing sick.  The disease is greatly increased.  Businesses are paralyzed.  The weather is extremely dry and cold.  The accidental Mayor has ordered doctors of the town to inspect the Park and the Old Hospital Vignette, to see which one best meets hygienic conditions to serve as a hospital. It is probable that the schools and universities will close as the epidemic descends.  The trading houses have mostly had to suspend operations due to lack of healthy balance of staff.  The police force are short more than 90 in the infantry and 8 or 10 of the cavalry.  In Montjuic there is not a health official anymore, and the vast majority of classes of troops are in bed.  The infantry barracks of Barcelona have reached the point of not being able to mount the guards.  In many cafes waiters have been replaced.  In an important manufacturing establishment a hundred workers are attacked by sickness.  In the Coast Guard, two out of five command individuals of the framework are in bed. In Valladolid there are many people that have been attacks, and much of the city is discouraged.  The theaters have closed their doos because of the attacks on the artists and entrepreneurs. At the civil government more than three employees did not attend on  30th of last month.  In Salamanca almost all of the Post Office staff suffer from the sickness.  In Albacete the flu continues many invasions, and given the cold, it is not as benign as in other areas.  In Alba of Tormes there are some cases present, with benign characters.  In Forrol there are increased cases of the reigning epidemic in our city.  In Piedrahita the storm is frightful. The inhabitants have had terrible frost for two months, but six months ago the temperature said 12 and 14 degrees below zero at night. Many people have left bed by given force with brandy or cologne, shivering from the cold, those who have to cross the road are wrapped in blankets and with radiators so not to freeze.  Needless  to say there is much flu.  A newspaper of Victoria says the following: “So many workers of the Northern railway, attacked by the reigning sickness, complete the services with formidable task, and if the sickness continues to climb like today, it is feared that the circulation of trains will stop.” In the barracks, to date, caution is advised but not considerable in number. In the Military Hospital yesterday 10 were attacked, in civilians the number is considerable.  The offices of the State and Corporations lack staff that is healthy.  The Treasury is found sick, about six or eight employees, and managers of Revenue and Contributions.  The force of the epidemic is less strong in neighborhoods. The flu continues to increase in Zaragoza, losing many in official centers, work shops, and restaurants.  In Gerona in the garrison there have been 60 severe cases of the prevailing disease.  In Valencia, the deputy and professor of medicine Amilo D. Gimeno died. His spouse was also found sick, and has worsened as a result of the painful loss.  The prevailing disease in this city has increased growth. Many of the afflicted families take refuge in the nearby towns. There are many attacks in the garrison.  The prevailing epidemic also appeared in the Real-City, but fortunately has been benign.  In the Seminar more than 20 seminarian were attacked, in the barracks of the Civil Guard there are 12 afflicted and the jail also has a large number of attacks.  Public services is highly resistant to the state of things, and trade has had considerable losses.  In Paris the flu or trancazo has developed also in Saboya despite the altitude of the country and the heavy snow continually falling there.  The rest of France is invaded.  In some hearings there is no need to suspend visits of the sick judges and lawyers.  The autopsies have been made in Paris of cadavers of the flu victims, all results of the illness present characters of a truly infectious fever.  The doctors say it is not the vulgar grippe, but an infectious affliction of a special nature.  The health situation in Paris seems to have improved, judging from the decrease of deaths.  However, the hospitals are crowded to the point where they can not admit any more patients.  The districts most affected by the epidemic are 18 and 19.

Each morning, at the consultation of the medicinal services, the service chiefs, arranging some beds left vacant during the day, see themselves under obligation to proceed to a veritable selection among the very numerous candidates that present themselves at the entrance, and to only admit, for lack of space, the most gravely infected sick people and the most needy.  All these sick, one understands it, are not infected with the flu, but many are in the predisposition period.  The epidemic, combined with physiological and moral misery, has caused an ailment in the area of the bronchial tubes and respiratory tract.  This mission is very difficult for all of the hospital service that multiplies with its ordinary dedication.  Today all the large schools where the epidemic had been reported were sent on vacation, one comprehends easily that it is no longer possible to establish statistics.  In the public and administrative services, one notices a veritable reduction in the number of absent people.  The majority of employees have gone back to work, and one hardly reports any new cases.  Deaths  The statistics have given, for the winter day December 31, the highest number of burials of the week.  It was 450, a rise of 106 from December 30.  This rise is explained perhaps by the fact that many burials were postponed, either for lack of funeral administration material, or because of desire expressed by the families themselves.  The lawyer conference could not yet have their habitual meeting.  Like the previous week, the speakers who had to take the floor, affected by the flu epidemic, had to excuse themselves.  The knowledgeable doctor Proust just sent the following report to the minister of the interior who had asked him for it: Paris, December 30 1889. Mr. Minister, In response to your letter today, I have the honor of providing you the following directions: The emotion provoked by the current epidemic should not surprise too much.  At all times, in effect, where it has shown itself, the flu has always been an important medical event.  An epidemic that strikes in a few days on all the capitals of Europe and rapidly wins over the New World, that disorganizes all services, cannot not awaken anxiety.  From the start, the epidemic was remarkable by the shortness of duration and the little gravity of the accidents.  Many communities (high schools, colleges, etc.) that counted hundreds of sick, did not have to register a single deceased nor even a single grave case.  But soon to the nervous and gastric forms were added the laryngeal, bronchitic, and pulmonary determinations.  Complications These complications, the pulmonary congestions, the pulmonary tuberculoses and the pneumonias, were above all observed in the people who, with the flu, had continued to deliver themselves to their occupations or had gone back to work too early, they who, still suffering, were exposing themselves to the cold: and, in the individuals already weakened for a long time by age or sickness.  This is, indeed, what was noted in the majority of previous epidemics. In the epidemic of 1733, the sickness did not look dangerous by itself; however it killed a large number of elderly people, of poor tuberculosis-infected people, and of other people weakened by sickness.  "During the epidemic of 1743, the sickness, although very widespread, was not dangerous.  After the third or fourth day, it ceded to properly directed care; the treatment was, in general, more a matter of diet than of a particular medication.  It hardly killed any except old people or people already chronically weakened by grave illnesses, or those in which an unpleasant disposition had permitted the development of a pneumonia, or certain children infected by pulmonary diseases." (Huxham.)  It was the same with the epidemic of 1762. (Monro.) There are therefore no very noticeable differences between what we see today and what happened in the past.  However, since a few days ago, one notes during the current epidemic some infectious forms of an exceptional gravity.  Mortality Although the mortality in Paris and in different towns in which the flu is observed right now is elevated, one can't say nonetheless that the current epidemic is very grave.  The mortality that it provokes, or rather that its complications provoke, is relatively minimal to the number of infected individuals.  Hardly one death in 1,000. The mortality number would reduce if, when one is infected by the flu, one did not commit the error of continuing to suffer the action of the cold, if one took care of oneself immediately.  If one watched over one's recovery, and if, in one word, one simply did not risk catching the flu, to see one's sickness distorted or aggravated by imprudences.  So, dressing warmly as soon as one catches the flu, not exposing oneself to the cold, treating oneself immediately, watching over one's recovery, such are the pieces of advice that it is necessary to give.  If this advice is followed, one will see the complications of the current epidemic disappear in a considerable proportion, which will not be any more grave than previous flu epidemics and no more grave than it was at the beginning either.  It is therefore important that the Public Assistance, the charity offices, and all the charitable works multiply, in favor of the poor, in the most highest indicated direction, all their methods of assistance.  Yours sincerely, etc. The inspector general of sanitary services A. PROUST.  Mr. Inspector General did not seem to have much compromise during the course of this remarkable work by its simplicity and its acumen.   That resembles a summary of published articles each day in all the newspapers. The fact stands that if, from the start, the administration had told the truth and taken necessary measures to halt the disease, the epidemic would not have made the large number of victims that we have the sad task of registering.  In Lille The Petit Nord says that the influenza has made especially worrying progress in Lille since, in several cases, the malady loses its benign and inoffensive form to become this sort of infectious pneumonia that makes numerous victims in Paris. They tell us between other maladies a singer from the Grand Theater, whose state would inspire the strongest worries. Many deadly cases showed up the day before yesterday, all characterized by the same symptoms.  In Marseille The Sémaphore says that the influenza has made its appearance in Marseille.  The cases are rather numerous but they keep a benign character and only establish a disagreeable reluctance.  The epidemic hits urban areas above all, employees of large administrations, workshops. But one only would know to give the influenza more importance than it has, and if we have believed that we had to talk about it to our fellow man, it's above all to insist on its benign character and to reassure people who are too quick to alarm.  Hussar Telegraph Operators From its side, the Soleil du Midi, says that the influenza continues to lay disarray in the majority of administrations.  Here is the telegraph that can no longer suffice, because of the relatively considerable number of its employees put out of combat, to transmit all its dispatches in time.  The military administration placed yesterday, at the service of the telegraphic offices of Marseille, hussars of good will and knowing the trade perfectly.  Our colleague learns that 11 pilots out of 62 are in bed, but in a state that doesn't offer the least worry. The mail personnel is the most particularly affected, around 115 employees are confined to bed. The epidemic has also hit, but in the least proportions, the personnel of the Maritime Companies, the excise duty, the customs, and the police. Half of the Gymnasium troop is sick. The doctors can't be enough for their task; however most of the cases are benign and mortality has not noticeably increased.  In Annonay Annonay is currently paying its tribute to the trendy malady.  The schools' students recently got dismissed.  At the college of Sainte-Barbe, 50 students and professors were infected in the same day and the institution of Sacré-Coeur has had 9 cases of epidemic; the personnel not infected were sent back yesterday. Numerous cases are reported in different factories.  In Laon The Journal de l'Aisne says that the influenza is spreading in the area.  They note numerous cases.  In Lunéville The Progrès de l'Est announces that the students from the college of Lunéville, following a few cases of influenza, were sent to their family last Saturday.  A Rouen We read in the Nouvelliste de Rouen: The epidemic grows without stopping.  Most of the artists from the Theater of the Arts are affected and they are not playing tonight because of the numerous unavailabilities. Many men were hit in the troupes of the garrison.   Abroad In Geneva, they note the death of Mr. Edouard Humbert, professor of French literature at the University. In Madrid, the tenor Gayarré is gravely ill with pneumonia.  His state is desperate. They telegraph from Madrid that the sanitary state is more preoccupying than the ministerial and political crisis.  Yesterday there were 200 deaths, being, since December 21, a total of 1,500, triple the ordinary mortality number.  They are delaying the opening of University courses; several theaters are closing for lack of an audience. We learn from Copenhagen that the number of people infected by influenza during last week passed 6,000.  Austria (From a correspondent) Vienna, 31 December. - The influenza epidemic, which continually increases, causes much anxiety in the population. The sanitary council has resolved to suspend the courses of all the schools of Lower Austria until January 7 and has begged the magistrate of Vienna to take measures in order to establish a hospital for people sick with influenza. (From a correspondent) Vienna, 31 December. - The epidemic strikes more and more strongly and the number of deaths increases every day, following complications that happen above all in the respiratory tracts. The archduke Charles-Louis, brother of the emperor, and his grandson the archduke Charles were attacked by influenza, but their state is nothing grave.  Germany (From a correspondent) Berlin, 31 December. - The office of statistics furnishes a few details on the influenza that are not without interest. At this time of year, mortality develops every year; nevertheless, one can establish that, in the first week of December, the epidemic caused 22 cases of death; in the second, 240 owed especially to afflictions of the respiratory system; in the third, 340 caused still by the same afflictions. We announce that the epidemic has started its period of decline.  England (From a correspondent)] London, 31 December. - Londen was plunged into darkness all day yesterday. We report a death from influenza, that of a typographic worker employed at a printing company where 40 or so of his colleagues were infected, but almost all of them lightly.

While the epidemic grows smaller in one town, it seems to make an appearance in another, all the while remaining benign. Nowhere are there signals of an alarming increase in the mortality rate.     In Nimes, the sickness is hitting with somewhat more force. The [governmental] administrations are affected, and the majority of (social) services are hindered (as a result). Railway workers are not being spared either. We have counted two sick employees out of ten. The prefect of Gard, Mr. Vatin, himself very sick, is bedridden. He did not have a New Years Day reception. In Vannes, official receptions had to also be ajourned, the prefect also being stricken with influenza. At the military hospital in Vernon, doctors and volunteering nuns have been affected. In several places, everyone has been more or less touched by the influenza, but report no serious cases thus far.     The influenza has made an appearance in Draguinan. We can currently count a large number of people affected by this illness which has spread throughout the entire [administrative] department of Var.                 The influenza has been felt just as equally in Tunis, as telegraphed to us by our correspondents in that city. A very large number of people have been taken ill. Even the weather is cold and wet.

London, 1 Jan. The diplomatic corps is very ill with the influenza. Salisbury is, as they say, will  take a trip abroad immediately after his recovery. Madrid, 1 January. The influenza  has increased again. Yesterday 200 had died. The hospitals are crowded. Brussels, 1 Jan. The Count and Countess of Flanders are infected with the influenza.  Paris, 2 Jan. The messages from Paris show that the province and the foreign countries seem to be at a standstill. The urban statistics count 2334 deaths for the elapsed week. The increase in the mortality rate is due exclusively to the development of illnesses of the respiratory organs and the chronically ill.  The number of deaths from this cause particularly has quadrupled. 22 have died alone from the influenza and its consequences.

This elevated mortality is due exclusively to maladies of respiratory organs and to chronic maladies leading fatally to death (consumption, heart disease, etc.), but that are suddenly aggravated.  There are only 22 deaths that are attributed to the flu or its results.  But pneumonia, which, in the corresponding year of 1888 had only caused 67 deaths, had caused 346 this week; acute bronchitis, 131 (instead of 42 in 1888); chronic bronchitis, 127 (instead of 47 in 1888); broncho-pneumonia, 138 (instead of 27 in 1888).  In summary, inflammatory respiratory diseases caused the elevated number of 742 deaths instead of around 200, the ordinary number at this time of year.

The epidemic still strikes with severity.  The maladies that derived from it or to which it gives a particular character of gravity caused a very large number of deaths as well as the number that you will see lower in the weekly statistics. In Vannes (From a correspondent) Vannes, January 1. - The official receptions of the prefecture could not take place, the prefect being infected by influenza.  The other receptions took place without incident. In Spain (From a correspondent) Madrid, January 1. - The epidemic continues to grow in Madrid and in the provinces.  The tenor Gayarré is still in a grave state.  An abundant snow fell today in Madrid; the temperature is mild and we hope for an improvement in the sanitary state.  The hospitals are absolutely packed.  Special doctors' services have been established.  Several theaters are closed temporarily.  A subscription is open in favor of the poor classes. In Belgium (From a correspondent) Bruxelles, January 1. - The countess of Flanders has had a relapse of influenza.  The count is equally infected with the sickness. In England London, January 1. - The diplomatic body is particularly tried by the influenza.  The count Haizfeld, ambassador of Germany, was the first attacked: he has been in bed for fifteen days.  A large number of other prominent diplomats are equally infected.

A few weeks ago because of his illness Carnot has replied to an old aquaintance of his family, whom he met in provincial business, when the visitor opined, regarding the blossoming of the shops since the exhibition, that everything is very good, if only there is no war: "The war is unlikely, for each and everyone completely unlikely.   Influenza. As shared with us from Tafers (a province in Switzerland), the influenza has also strongly gripped many communities in the district of Sense.  For the influenza or other illnesses, in which the appetite and the strength is lost, we can best recommend a cure with the genuine Eisen cognac of Colleiz, the efficacy of which is proved sufficient through the shining results, the same results were obtained  in the last 16 years. Excellent strength and means of recovery. The only one rewarded in Paris in 1889 and Barcelona in 1888 and which was decorated with 19 other diplomas and medals.

Once again about the influenza. The French bacteriologist Bouchard explained the difference between the "Dengue" and the influenza , the former is an epidemic, the latter is a pandemic illness, meaning it seizes simultaneously a large number of men from a wide area, without being transmitted by infection. Bouchard does not believe, that the influenza has a specific bacillus;  an otherwise innocuous, but a bacillus which lives in humans could through an atmospheric change become dangerous and create an illness.  Professor Proust, director of the Public Health Service in Paris, writes in a report to the Minister Constans of the worsening of fatalities caused by the influenza and the imprudence of this, that people, which suffer from the influenza, and despite this return to their businesses, too early suffer or expose themselves to the cold.

153	La Lanterne	Paris				1890-01-04T00:00:00Z	http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7505368s	THE EPIDEMIC THE SITUATION APPEARS TO IMPROVE In Paris. - In the hospitals. - In Saint-Cyr. - In the North. - In Marseille. - Foreign administrations. The situation is still rather grave in the hospitals and hospices in Paris and in the suburbs where there no longer remains more than one current hour, even one fixed bed, or extra person available. Each morning, at the consultation of the medical services, the chiefs of service having several beds left vacant during the day at their disposal, see themselves under obligation to make a veritable selection among the very numerous candidates who present themselves at the entrance, and to only admit, for lack of space, the most gravely infected sick people and the most needy. Yet, even though the number of sick is still considerable, it is easy to note a slight improvement in the general state. In the majority of administrations, in effect, the personnel have returned, almost restarting their service completely. The Saint-Cyriens The re-entry of the students of the military school of Saint-Cyr, which had to occur last Sunday, is postponed starting now until the following Sunday January 12. In Bourges In Bourges, numerous cases were reported at the large diocesan seminary, which was dismissed immediately.  The official world has also been fairly well-tried; Mr. Marchai, archbishop of Bourges, had to give up receiving the first day of the year; the prosecutor general, hit since fifteen days ago, could not receive it either.  Finally the prefect, rather gravely infected, and who also had his three sick children, also had to give up receiving January 1.  The secretary general of the prefecture, the vice president of the Prefecture Council, a wildlife inspector, etc., are sick.  However, save two or three already aged persons, the epidemic has not yet caused deaths. In Brest In Brest, the dry and severe temperature seems to contribute to a resurgence of the flu epidemic.  The entries to the maritime hospital have noticeably increased.  The sanitary state of the garrison and the flotilla crew is nonetheless satisfactory.  Austerlitz and Borda are still unharmed. Aboard the Bretagne, lookout post of the State, some new cases have been noted.  The sanitary state of the Ariege has improved. Finally, the "influenza" strikes among the crews of the vessels of the Mediterranean squadron and of the ship school of the gunners, the Crown.  On this last building, the number of cases is rather considerable. In Lille The "Progres du Nord" says that the number of sock is considerable in Lille and that the epidemic has noticeably improved for two days. Around Lille, in Hellemmes, for example, the influenza commits veritable ravages.  The working class, in particular, which the fever seemed to respect for some time, is currently very tried. Forty-two workshop workers of the North railroad engine and some thirty young people from 15 to 18 years, belonging to the apprentices' workshop, are very ill. In the communal schools, several cases are also reported. In Marseille The "Petit Marseillais," which went around the the different administrations where the conglomeration of people can aid the spreading of influenza, says that at Marseille's tobacco factories, they signal almost no sick; two or three employees at most.  It is true that this is the age of the inventory, and that of 1,200 workers, hardly 50 are busy at the moment. The personnel of the Company of tramways counts 28 sick. The postal and telegraph administration is the one that was hit the most, there are nearly fifty of the personnel confined to bed at the moment. In the customs tax service, of a personnel of about 800 people, they counted last night, at 5:00, 56 sick, and still all the information from the remote customs offices have not yet arrived. The police service has been equally affected by the epidemic.  Currently 55 peace guardians and 15 agents are counted.  Some police commissaries have been equally infected. At the mayor's office, some municipal advisors were equally affected.  Three or four workers or office boys are sick. In the prefecture, the cabinet chief of the prefect has been bed-bound for a dozen days.  Several office chiefs are equally sick as well as three or four subordinate employees. Influenza cases are also reported among the employees of the train station (33), of the Forges and Construction Sites, of the maritime Delivery Services, in several bank buildings, etc.  At the pilots' post, of 60 enrolled, there are 12 sick. Finally, of 500 customs officials, there are currently 45 sick.  The management of the customs immediately organized an infirmary where its modest servants are treated with the utmost care. In the hospitals the number of sick is equally important. The doctors are literally beseiged in their cabinet and can't be enough for the task.  Several had to stay in bed. In summary, the number of sick - grippe or influenza - is considerable. In Poitiers In Poitiers, the influenza struck equally with some severity in the military population.  The regiments were tried one after the other, the 125th infantry first, then the 20th artillery, finally the 33rd paid successively their tribute to the malady. Some cases of typhoid fever have aggravated this situation.  But the bad seems halted, numerous permissions given on this subject conjured the danger. In the civilian population, they report very few cases, however neither the superintendent of the Academy, nor the prosecutor general have received the New Year's Day occasion. In Perpignan The influenza strikes with intensity in Perpignan; the cases are very numerous among the personnel of the workshops and the stores; the police and the administrative services are completely disorganized.  The epidemic keeps an absolutely benign character. In Austria (From a correspondent) Vienna, January 2. - The influenza, which grows more every day, has become a veritable epidemic.  Most of the cases now present rather grave symptoms and are often complicated by pneumonia.  Many offices and workshops find themselves in embarrassment, numerous employees being sick with this malady.  Following the growth of the influenza, the vacations in the public schools just got prolonged until January 7. (From a correspondent) Vienna, January 2. - The epidemmic continues to strike in Vienna, the mortality which is usually 40 deaths per day, since the flu lost its benign character, reaches 110. At the Vatican (From a correspondent) Rome, January 2. - The epidemic spreads in Rome; it strikes particularly at the Vatican at this time, where, as they say, they are very alarmed. In Germany (From a correspondent) Frankfurt, January 2. - Mr. Miquel, first burgomaster of the town, is gravely suffering from the influenza, complicated by a pulmonary tuberculosis. In Spain (From a correspondent) Madrid, January 2. - The influenza epidemic continues to develop in Madrid and in the provinces; the number of deaths will rise from it.

In Paris, the improvement that we reported, for not being as fast as one would desire, was not less noteworthy, especially since the temperature suffered this lowering that we noted and that the weather got really cold.  Yesterday morning, there was a much smaller blockage noticed in the consultation services in the hospitals and the entry demands were much less numerous than the preceding days. Following the disarray that still reigns in the morticians' administration, very overworked right now and still aided a little by auxiliaries for everyday service, and also, following the lack of cars and wall hangings serving at funerals, some number of burials to which they had to proceed Thursday had to be postponed, by the request of the families, to yesterday. The number of burials found itself higher by this fact for the day of Friday January 3 at [?]. High schools By a note sent to the Official Newspaper, the minister of public instruction lets it be known that the re-entry to all the high schools and colleges of Paris (boys and girls) previously set at January 5 at night, is postponed to January 12 at night for boarders, until January 13 in the morning for day students. Coach drivers The coach drivers seem to have suffered little from the epidemic.  At the Parisian Company and at the Urban, the service is done, during the holidays, as regularly as ever, and the number of sick coach drivers is no larger than normal in this season. The military At the Military School, where the influenza made itself known rather vigorously, there was a noticeable improvement in the sanitary state and the number of sick strongly tends to diminish.  We note however in the Paris garrison, which had been affected little at the start, some number of new cases fortunately without gravity. In the barracks of the Chateau-d'Eau, of the Pépiniere and of the quay of Orsay, the number of sickly people having risen, the infirmaries of these barracks are full to capacity. In Nantes Nantes, January 3. - The influenza strikes a little more these past two days.  There are two hundred sick at the infantry barracks.  Several families are affected; but there are no grave cases. The mortality number is no higher than that of the previous years. In Tulle (From a correspondent) Tulle, January 3. - Five hundred arsenal workers are infected with influenza. In Toulon (From our particular correspondent) Toulon, January 3. - The epidemic strikes with a certain intensity in our town.  The majority of reported cases degenerate into pneumonia.  The hospitals are overflowing with sick people.  A thousand arsenal workers are sick.  The doctor Payrremond, decorated in 1884 during the cholera epidemic just died.  The number of deaths suffers an alarming progression. In Algeria (From a correspondent) Algiers, January 3. - About a thousand people are infected with influenza, but without grave character.  The epidemic is focusing principally on the personnel of administrations of theaters.  The employees of the post office were the first infected. The influenza has stricken equally among the troops of the garrison. Numerous cases in the suburbs of Algiers are reported. In Austria  (From a correspondent) Vienna, January 3. - The prince Charles of Auersperg is gravely ill; he is infected with a phthisis.  The doctors are losing hope to save him. In England (From a correspondent) London, January 3. -The influenza makes constant progress in London.  At the central telegraph office, the number of absent people would already be 200.  A typography worker recently succumbed to this sickness; that's the third; and a remarkable coincidence, all three work at neighboring printing presses.  In the three cases, the influenza had degenerated into pleurisy or pneumonia. (From a correspondent) London, January 3. - The press continues to be silent on the sanitary state of the town and is content giving news on famous people who are sick, without talking about their sickness; that's how they announce that Lord Salisbury is completely recovered.  But it is nevertheless true that there are a lot of sick people in London and that the mortality has risen in strong proportions. In Russia (From a correspondent) Saint Petersburg, January 3. - We notice that there was last year and the year before that in the north of Russia, in the region of the gulf of Kara, an influenza epidemic that cost the lives of over 200,000 Russians. In Switzerland Lucerne, January 3. - The re-entry of town schools there were missing, this morning, 5 masters, 5 mistresses, 469 boys and 655 little girls, all sick with influenza.  The vacation was prolonged until January 13.  It is the same for the cantonal school.  There are 4,000 sick in Lucerne.  			
155	El Dia 	Madrid				1890-01-05T00:00:00Z	http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002269584&search=&lang=es	THE EPIDEMIC Here, with much interest, the news following Madrid and the epidemic, have without a doubt taken the development of influenza elsewhere.  To my understanding, the illness can be explained without difficulty, as the severity of influenza consists in that it thoroughly prepares the terrain (paves the road)  for the remaining bronchial and lung conditions , and Madrid being a city in which these thrive, even in ordinary times , currently the rigor of these conditions should be much higher .  In this current epidemic it is a serious responsibility to be a doctor in Paris, Dr. Brouardel , dean of the medical school, treated Ferran quite badly . This man is one of the doctors that does not emit purely medical advice, but always has to get involved in things that don’t even pertain to him, and when he involves himself in political and commercial manners, he does give himself an appearance of a charlatan and fraud instead of that of a true medic.  For our Dr, Brouardel insisted, when influenza appeared, to say that things did not matter, and thus achieved: 1. That individuals begin neglecting themselves, treat the disease lightly and then get exposed to the terrible consequences. 2. That schools, barracks and other agglomerations formed influenza as a malignant character. If this man had been more concerned in medicine and a little less on whether bonuses would be sold or not, it is probable that a few hundred people would not have perished. It is true that the fault lies with those who ignore such medical consultations, which should occupy the position of political intrigue and the skill with which flatter the passions, not their knowledge. Moreover, the epidemic appears to wreak havoc among those who commit indiscretions. I've had it, with great force and bronchial complications, and so far, said in propitious moments, tried not to breathe cold air that could cause bronchial irritation with external applications of tincture of iodine, and a few tablespoons of carbolic syrup Vial, I'm moving forward without great difficulty. The main thing is, however, not be exposed to humid air while still coughing.

In the hospitals the number of sick coming for consultations has also noticeably decreased. The situation in the departments remains without change: in Burzhe, for example, the epidemic has strengthened in the last few days. Medical officers estimate the number of sick at 10,000, which makes up about one quarter of the population. In Kantal, there are also many sick people. In almost all administrative institutions a great share of service personnel are doing poorly and did not appear for work. In Brest, the situation has improved a little, but recently there have been many serious cases resulting in death. In Marsel, on December 30, there were 77 cases of death. In Aven’on, the epidemic continues to rage with its earlier force. In the schools after the holidays only one-half of the students returned…[article continues]

Lucerne. The "Lucern Daily Newspaper" writes: "Before Christmas we had very little information about the absences in the state schools ; but when the schools were opened on Thursday, 469 boys and 655 girls were missing, so about 40 percent of the school-aged youth. Also 5 males teachers and 5 female teachers were absent. These circumstances were brought to the attention of the aldermen, who held seats, and they passed a resolution, that the holidays should be extended until the 13th of January." 4000 cases of influenza are counted in Lucerne.  In the schools of Reußbühl at Lucerne, it appeared  on the 2nd of January that only 120 of 250 schoolchildren  are still suffering from a severe cough.

The overload observed at the consultations of medicinal services of the hospices and hospitals of the town of Paris, tends from day to day to diminish, and, the number of requests left at the offices of entry or expressed by the sick themselves at the free hospital consultations, is hardly superior anymore to the one raised each year at the time of the bad season. In town, the situation is still noticeably the same, but the real cases reported with accompaniment of complications are in a much lesser proportion. The morticians' administration proceeded yesterday January 4, at 366 burials.  On the day of January 3, the number of deaths for the town of Paris rose to 432. This number breaks down by arrondissement in the following manner: 1st arrondissement, 4; 2nd, 7; 3rd, 18; 4th, 30; 5th, 15; 6th, 18; 7th, 18; 8th, 16; 9th, 7; 10th, 28; 11th, 31; 12th, 30; 13th, 17; 14th, 21; 15th, 27; 16th, 6; 17th, 19; 18th, 22; 19th, 28; 20th, 35. Total: 432.  We know that the Polytechnic School, where numerous cases had been reported, was starting their vacation some days before the time of yearly required vacations.  This school had their re-entry yesterday.  The sanitary situation is excellent and it is hardly so if some students, kept in their family by a measure of prudence, were missing yesterday at registration. Same state of affairs were reported at the Central School which, it too, had had its re-entry. A morning newspaper announces that Mr. Grevy had been sick by the "influenza."  That is not the case, and the health of the former president of the Republic is still excellent. They buried together, yesterday at the cemetery of Saint-Mandé, three victims of the epidemic: Mrs. Hoffmann, widow of a police chief, and her two daughters, grown: one of thirty-eight and the other of thirty-six years.  Mrs. Hoffmann confined herself to bed last Sunday.  A phthisis soon announced itself and the poor woman succumbed.  Her eldest daughter, taken almost at the same time, died a few hours later.  As for the younger sister, she experienced such an emotion, at this double catastrophe, that she died of shock. In the suburbs, the epidemic still strikes with some intensity. Some number of municipal advisors of Saint-Cloud were affected, and the mayor also paid his tribute to the epidemic.  The Council meetings were adjourned until further orders. Outside Paris Of all parts of the province we receive information that shows that the epidemic strikes all over with severity.  On the coastline of the Ocean and the Mediterranean, the populations are especially tested. In Germany (From a correspondent) Dortmund, January 4. - The influenza has been striking harshly among the miners for several days; the extraction of coal suffers a lot from this state of affairs. The Gazette of Rhine and of Westphalia says that the teams are currently decimated by the malady. In England (From a correspondent) London, January 4. - Four hundred postal and telegraph employees are affected by the influenza. Lord Salisbury always stays in his chambers. According to the newspapers, the doctors believe that the prime minister had caught the sickness from the dispatches of the ambassadors from Paris and from Saint-Petersburg, who had been suffering from the influenza. In Austria-Hungary (From a correspondent) Prague, January 4. - The prince Charles of Auersperg is deceased today.  The influenza continually grows.  All the hospitals are packed.  In Presbourg, the garrison especially is infected.  The archduke Frederic has been confined to bed for several days. In Spain (From a correspondent) Madrid, January 4. - The influenza epidemic continues to grow in the provinces: schools, theaters, and public establishments are closed in a large number of towns, 340 soldiers from the garrison of Vitoria were sick with the malady. A fine, sharp rain has been falling since yesterday in Madrid, where the number of deaths was 213.  The temperature has become a lot milder; everyone hopes that the rain will influence the sanitary state. In the United States (From a correspondent) New York, January 4. - Influenza is reported from different places. Several people sick with maladies that followed the influenza have committed suicide.  The schools and prisons are very tried; the deaths are numerous.  The situation would be just as unfavorable in Mexico.  Even in New York, the number of deaths for today has risen to 220, which is without precedent for the winter.  The rising of mortality is caused by bronchitis and phthisis.  The number of sick police agents is 357. In Italy (From a correspondent) Rome, January 4. - The influenza continues to make progress in all of Italy.  In Cremona, in Sienna, in Ferrari, in Florence numerous cases have been reported.  In Turin, the epidemic grows.  In Milan, at the word of the Secolo, there remain hardly any families from which one member at least is not infected.  In Verona, the postal administration, from the railroad and from the telegraph are entirely disorganized by one absence from a large number of employees.  			
163	Freiburg Nachrichten	Lucerne		Freiburg		1890-01-07T00:00:00Z		The famous water-healing practioner Father Kneip said the following about the influenza in Bad Wörishofen (Bavaria): "The influenza originates, historically, most easily and quickly through a swift temperature change. Cold and warm, and because we are softening in current times, so the rapid change of nature can also easily penetrate into a myriad of natures. The cold of the atmosphere comes into a duel with the warmth of nature, it fails especially so much easier to the disadvantage of the latter by artifical head and neck clothing and an inflammation causes in the throat, which expands to the breast, head, and lastly to the whole body. I want to make the signs of this illness clear, and introduce them through an example: Yesterday evening I was so healthy and strong and felt no trace of malaise. Today I am half paralyzed, that I am no longer able to go, and my feet tremble. I have such a headache, that I am completely dizzy. I have a stinging and burning in my throat, so that I can't swallow. For this fast influnenza attack, I give the following advice: Go to bed without delay, wash the throat, breast, and the whold body with completely cold water, and bind a dry linen cloth to the throat, and don't cover onself up neatly, but not to cumbersomely. Do this ten times in ten hours. Then the whole body should be washed with cold water as quickly as possible. From this washing comes such a sweat over the body, that the ill lay in bed as if bathed and with these sweats the last remains of the illness have also disappeared, the strenghts of the peasant servants are returned. Perhaps quite a few people ask, how these simple practices haver work on this illness? So listen, readers: The cold has received the rule in the throat and noticed an inflammation, this was hardly emerged, so streamed this fire into the blood, it brought too much blood to the head and throat, the extremities are cold and bloodless. Through the washing the pores of the skin are opened, to the skin a new warming is formed, especially through the dry poultice of the cloth. Thus an emanation came from the neck and the head and so the transfugal is discharged within the designated hour. The dry cloth attracted, the water dissolved and so everything is discharged, which had taken root. From inside the servant was given every hour a spoonful of water, which dissolved that on the inside and channeled it out. What the water and the winding of the upper body, which causes the complete washing of the whole body; all pores were opened, the warmth was increased through the washing. The warm bed directed everything in the morbid nature of the fluids and it is possbile to discard the unwelcome guest in 18 hours.   Lucerne. On last Thursday the state schools should have been reopened, 5 male teachers, 5 female teachers, 460 boys, and 650 girls were missing because they were sick with the influenza.

As a rule it can be referred, the influenza is overlooked in the vast majority of cases of complete recovery. Rothnagel discussed the frequent, noticeable appearances  of genuine croupous pneumonia. It can be said with complete certainty, that one internal and substantial link doesn't exists between the pneumonia and the influenza, however some external influence is present. A pneumonia epidemic will increase the influenza epidemic, since a pneumonia develops easier for some individuals, who already suffer from pulmonary catarrh, which is very often just the influenza. There is no actual prophylactic protection against the influenza, which carries the character of a pandemic. As far as it goes, direct contact with those ill with influenza should b e avoided. Rothnagel recommends mainly conservation and care in the convalescence, especially to stay in a consistent room temperature as long as possible during the convalescence.

168	La Lanterne	Paris				1890-01-07T00:00:00Z	http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75053718	THE MONDAY TABLETS Popular hygiene: regarding the epidemic. - Winter and fog. - Seasonal maladies. - Precautions to take In any epidemic, the best regime to observe is to not change your habits.  The idea is to above all not be frightened, it is true that this advice is not always easy to follow, given that fear is a feeling independent of reason and willpower.  Since the current sickness, many people imagine themselves escaping the bad by taking infusions and purges.  This makes absolutely no progress, the remedies are effective when one is sick; in good health, they are useless or harmful. But between the uselessness of taking these medications inappropriately and the necessity of surrounding oneself with precautions, there is a difference.  The winter season is generally unhealthy due to fog and continual humidity.  It is therefore prudent at this time of year to protect yourself from sicknesses or illnesses brought about by atmospheric disturbances that affect our organs more or less.  Whether it's colds or respiratory infections, the flu, influenza, or the current epidemic that affects such a large number of people, the best way to fight these unpleasant winter effects is to dress in warm clothing and to avoid air currents, sudden temperature transitions, and to make yourself do some exercise every day, walking, gymnastics, or limb movements, so that circulation is maintained and so that your skin can fill its secreting functions. The humid atmosphere that reigns right now has the effect of irritating the lungs and inflaming them, diminishing perspiration.  It is therefore necessary to solve these inconveniences with movement, a healthy diet, and warm clothing. An important point is to have dry feet; the shoe is too often sacrificed to vanity.  Striving to make "small foot" is contrary to health.  In narrow shoes, blood does not circulate and cooling is easy.  Shoes should only be considered the way to protect your feet from the cold and humidity. You also have to, in winter, cover your kidneys, your chest, but not the throat like a lot of people do.  Head scarves, mufflers, especially when they are too tight, are unhealthy because they make blood collect in the throat and predispose you to throat illnesses and infections.  			
169	La Lanterne	Paris				1890-01-07T00:00:00Z	http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75053718	THE EPIDEMIC THE SITUATION APPEARS TO IMPROVE Warmer temperature. - In the schools. - Questions of hygiene.  - Memorandum from the minister of war. - In France. - Abroad. The warm and rainy temperature that has been here for two days appears to have caused a halt in the obvious improvement that we have reported.  It is necessary at present to redouble precautions and avoid opening yourself up to epidemic attacks. Until today, the terrible sickness has, if not brought about, at least birthed the cause of a large number of deaths.  The mortality rose in proportions that would be worrying if it wasn't known how easy it is to protect oneself from the consequences of the epidemic by a prudent rest and easy treatment.  Yet, like Dr. Proust said, at the last meeting of the council of hygiene of the Seine department, the epidemic seems to be entering a period of decline. At the polytechnic school, the number of missing students is nine; it is seven at the central school.  In these two establishments, the sanitary state is excellent. Deaths We gave, in our number from yesterday, the number of deaths in Paris during the day of Friday.  We can complete this information today by publishing the total number of deaths arisen during the week of Sunday December 29 to Friday January 3.  The total number of deaths had been, the previous week, 2,334.  Adding to 2,511, the total of the first six days of the past week, the average number 418, for the first day of Saturday, of which the statistics are not yet done, one had, for this complete week, an approximate total of 2,929 deaths. The number of burials in Paris, for Sunday, yesterday, is 420. At the Hygiene Council On the other hand, we extract the following passage from the official report from the meeting held the day before yesterday January 3 by the Hygiene Council and of Hygiene of the Seine: Mr. Proust makes it known that Mr. the doctor Jacques Bertillon, supervisor of the Municipal Statistics for the town of Paris, recently presented a most interesting report on mortality, in Paris, during the year 1889 and principally in the month of December.  It is due to the information gathered by Mr. Bertillon that the flu epidemic that has struck several times did not raise the mortality in infants up to the age of fifteen years.  The mortality has especially focused on people from twenty to forty years and it was still more considerable in those of forty to sixty; it even tripled.  Almost all elderly people were untouched. In this group of sick people that succumbed, there are, in one part, the people with phthisis, the cardiacs, the hemiplegics, and people affected by albuminuria, of which the morbid state presents a more accessible area to the malady.  There are, in another part, the not sick people, but simply suffering from the flu, who went back to work too quickly. In the army The minister of war recently sent out the following memo to the captains of the army corps to give instructions in order to stop the epidemic from making too much progress in the army: My dear general, The flu epidemic that currently strikes necessitates the use of some preventative measures on which I have the honor to call your attention to particularly, as well as that of the director of the Health Service of your army corps; they can be summarized thus: The duration of exercises outside, especially in the morning, will be as short as the necessities of instruction permit; these exercises will be regulated such that the periods of immobility are as little prolonged as possible and that the men are almost continually moving. However, one will not lose the view that a progressive and moderate training es one of the ways to gain resistance to the epidemic's influence on the part of men who are not yet sick. When the localities lend themselves to it, the exercises will be held in closed and covered places (horse riding schools, stores, halls, etc.), already for the troops' usage or momentarily placed at their disposal by the municipalities. The posts and chores must be reduced to strict necessity.  The sentinels will be dismissed all hours and they will make sure that they wear their overcoats.  Outside the quarters, the horse troops must have their overcoats; in the infantry, the vest will always be worn under the greatcoat.  Because of frequent abdominal complications in the ongoing epidemic, the flannel belt will be used.  In the case where the malady tends to propagate in a troop corps, the commanding general of the army corps will be able to, on the opinion of the directer of health services, arrange the temporary allocation of a light infusion of sweet tea (3 grams of tea and 10 grams of sugar) per man per day which will be distributed to the men in the meal interval (morning and night). The expense of this hot drink and tonic will be reimbursed to the corps by the health service. These allocations and the expense that they will have brought about will be shown to the minister (7th direction) at the end of the epidemic. Sufficient premises will be prepared in each barracks to receive if needed for observation of the slightly sick people and to treat the recovering without encumbering the infirmaries. These premises will be suitably heated, experience having proved that the principal danger of the flu comes from the penetrating action of the cold on the already influenced respiratory organs. The doctors will very attentively watch over the sick people infected by an infection, even slight, of the respiratory tract and those that their morbid medical history and their organic constitution would signal as requiring to offer less resistance to the malady.  All useful precautions will be taken so that the sick are not exposed to temperature drops during their transport to the hospital. It will be allowed, within the limits of demands of the service, permissions that especially require men weak of constitution to be the object. You will want to give orders well so that the officers and doctors, in which concern them especially, assure the rigorous execution of these prescriptions. In Argenteuil The epidemic strikes in Argenteuil with such an intensity that a third of the population, no matter the age and social condition of the individuals, has already paid their tribute to the malady. However, if the proportion of sick people is at least as high as in Paris, the accidents are infinitely more rare here.  There has not been until today a single case of death brought about directly by the flu and the deaths due to complications of the sickness, pneumonia, broncho-pneumonia, bronchitis, pulmonary congestion, have been until the present rather rare for not raising to the level of mortality higher than the normal number at this time of year. The predominant form of the sickness reported in Argenteuil is that which accompanies fever and aching without inflammation of the respiratory tracts, that is to say of all those of which the recovery can stop the fastest. In Perpignan (From a correspondent) Perpignan, January 5. - The cases of influenza are very numerous among the civilian population and the garrison. A large number of officers and the major part of the employees of the public administrations are infected. The re-entry of the college had to be postponed to January 15 due to the unavailability of several professors and supervisors. The secular schools are dismissed for 8 days. In Rivesaltes and Saint-Laurent-la-Salanque half the population is victim to the epidemic. In Rouen (From a correspondent) Rouen, January 5. - The influenza continues its progress. The small commerce is particuarly hit and in a number of families, everyone, even the servants, are bed-bound. Fortunately the epidemic has stayed benign up to this point. The headmaster of the Corneille high school has pushed back the date of the students' re-entry. In Dijon (From a correspondent) Dijon, January 5. - The epidemic strikes particularly in the workshops and the administrations. At the telegraph office, 12 employees of 50 are affected. In the police, 18 agents of 48 had to interrupt their service. At the railroad, the personnel is absolutely decimated. At the theater, over half of the personnel waits for the other half to recover to take their leave. In Beaune, many people are attacked by the sickness; a large number of soldiers that came with permission to spend the New Year's Day festivities with their family are affected by the epidemic and in the absolute impossibility to rejoin their corps. In the schools numerous cases are reported. In Nantes (From a correspondent) Nantes, January 5. - A resurgence of influenza has manifested, since the morning of the day before yesterday, at the Cambronne barracks.  They count around 200 sick men. Fortunately there were no deaths to register. In Nancy (From a correspondent) Nancy, January 5. - The train station personnel as well as that of the postal service and telegraph office were rather mistreated by the sickness.  Several cases were declared among the employees of various administrative services. At the military hospital, the number of sick soldiers is of little importance. Numerous cases are reported in Jarville and in Maxeville. In Bridge-on-Mousson, the people infected with influenza are more and more numerous; it is from the families that have three or four members confined to bed. In Vannes (From a correspondent) Vannes, January 5. - Numerous cases of influenza have been produced in the garrison and among the population, but without any gravity. In England (From a correspondent) London, January 5. - The influenza makes rapid progress.  The public administrations and the large houses of commerce are already very tried. In the United States (From a correspondent) New York, January 5. - The influenza takes a more and more dangerous character.  Numerous suicides of people infected by the sickness are reported. The temperature is of a spring-like mildness, but the rains are frequent. In Russia (From a correspondent) Moscow, January 5. - With the cold the influenza has disappeared.  According to the municipal statistics the number of sick has passed 300,000. The short rumor that the count Cheremetief, grand marshal of the Moscow nobility, renounced his current duties and received a high-level job in the court.

In Roulaix, the number of attacks has been so considerable, that some factories and stores have had to close their doors during some days: in Rouen the number of attacks is calculated to six or seven thousand; in Marsella each day you take bigger proportions, until the point that you start to make the postal service impossible; in Nancy the attack has been a big part of the garrison, and successively like many of the French departments.         In Vienna, the epidemic began to decrease, considerably increasing in the older part of the Austria’s departments; in London their peak continues in all, having been 400 attacks on mail and telegraph employees; in Nantes there are 200 attacks on soldiers and some individuals, but it has not registered any serious case; en Algeria and other points it has presented itself with quite force.         In London, Mme. Glandstone has presided over the distribution of awards to the volunteers of Hawarden. M. Herber Glandstone, member of the House of Commons, has pronounced a speech, declaring that it is indispensable, to increase the credit granted for them by a million, if they want to have that strong military in good condition.         The empress – Federico has visited the royal Roman family: the interview has been very cordial and has lasted two hours.          Soon they will be able to commit murders at a distance and at late hours of the night, without more pain than what the hunting produces from the partridge to the expectation.         A Russian general has invented a shooting procedure for the artillery, that permits to distinguish the bundle in the darkness and at long distances. He is studying the application of this system to the rifle.         During the present month of January, there will be three big banquets and reception in the Élysée Palace.         The first will take place the 9th, and the commanders of all bodies of the Navy will be invited; the second will take place the 16th and the diplomatic body will attend, and the third, will be celebrated on the 30th, will be presented to the members of the offices of both Houses.         The Union of French Women will celebrate its customary annual party the 18th of the current, in the salons of the Continental Hotel, the Army officials attending the ceremony.         The military authorities have promised to the organizing Committee, to provide as much support they can to give the greatest splendid ceremony.  It says something of the reform of some Paris streets. Until now I only could say to you that the Rue Lafayette – one of the most centrally situated – will be in brief illumination by the electric light and paved of wood, news that I believe has to please some of my readers, because to more than other purely Spanish houses, the Spain and American Grand Hotel Central is in her, by that those points that visit the capital of the Republic have passed by it and passed the best part of it. In spite of the influenza, Paris enjoys itself, and frequents the theaters. In the Comic Opera, the “Barber of Seville” y the “Daughter of the Regiment” achieve large successes, in the theater of Port Saint-Martin they are applauded ever night more than the interpellation of “Joan of Arc.”  Until my next. – G.

The Bern market report from the 7th of January showed weakly. It seems the terrible influenza still spits everywhere. The vegetable market shows large gaps namely in the under streets. Also the heavy livestock market is  for a month not represented as normal. While it develops  from the most beautiful objects available in a lively commerce. It proves also, that the prices still have not returned, rather they remain very fixed. For a moderate rest, supporting, 46 five livres were required and also solved approximately. The small livestock market is said to match this. A large exhibition, means  demands and maintaining continuous fixed prices.

St. Gallen. In Bruggen, Sir Dr. Fisch died of a short illness, he was around 35 years old. The deceased, a very busy and efficient doctor, was stricken last week by the influenza, which developed into pneumonia and caused the death of the popular and commonly highly esteemed man. On the same day (Sunday), Sir Aug. Thomann, conductor of the associated Swiss trains, was carried to the grave. Sir Thomann, a vigorous and healthy man in the prime of his life, has likewise become a victim of the influenza.

173	La Lanterne	Paris				1890-01-08T00:00:00Z	http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7505372p	THE EPIDEMIC THE SITUATION GETS WORSE OUTSIDE PARIS In the hospitals. - Burials. - Rescue services in uniform. - For the recovering. - Distribution. - Outside Paris and abroad. We have announced that, having seen the overload of the Parisian hospitals, a whole quarter of the begging area of Nanterre had been hospitalized and placed at the disposal of the Public Assistance, who confined them there, as long as the central Paris hospitals would be overloaded, the incurable sick, infirm, or infected with chronic illnesses. Although placed in a special corps of the building and subjected to a regime offering larger advantages than those in the Paris hospitals, the administration of Public Assistance thought that the neighborhood of the prisoners might displease the sick appointed to the office.  It also decided to only send to Nanterre those who made the request to do so.  This measure having been notified to all the hospitals, some fifty sick people immediately asked yesterday for their transfer to the new premises assigned to them in Nanterre. The Public Assistance also recently converted the Necker hospital into a new building that will allow the installation of some forty new beds. The number of burials yesterday is 327. Emergency personnel The commission charged with distributing clothing to the poor and needy people recovering from influenza continued yesterday the samples of all kinds that had been subjected to it. The objects were chosen with the sole preoccupation that they should serve to protect the workers who are called to go back without delay to their workshop or construction site from the dangers of recovery and from the action of the cold. The question of the distribution was made the object of a meticulous discussion.  It was first discussed that a tenth would be reserved to protect from any eventuality. Here's how the nine tenths were distributed: it is known that the intention of the minister of the interior is to help benefit from this distribution not only Parisian workers, but also those in the suburbs. The proportion of a fifth, first attributed to the suburbs due to its population, appeared insufficient, being given, of one part, the considerable number given, from workers that live in the suburbs and, in the second place, the special advantages of which currently benefit the Parisian population. It was therefore decided that the suburbs would receive three tenths of the objects distributed. Of the six remaining tenths, four will be immediately distributed between the twenty offices of charity, following the rules adopted by the service of the Public Assistance. Two tenths will be attributed to the hospitals of Paris and to the national recovery asylums. The goods will be delivered to the Hospital Boulevard Public Assistance central store; they will be verified by experts, then they will be placed, according to the adopted mode of distribution, at the disposal of the charity offices, hospitals, and the mayors of the suburbs. The first deliveries were made yesterday. In Brest  (From a correspondent) Brest, January 6. - The influenza grows in intensity.  Fifty-six students from the Borda are in the hospital, where a hundred marines and soldiers were also admitted yesterday.  The civilian population is harshly tried.  The doctors and pharmacists are overburdened.  Last night was supposed to be the re-entry of students of the high school; the headmaster, on the advice of the doctor, telegraphed the superintendent of Rennes to request the extension of vacation.  The superintendent of Rennes agreed only to temporarily let the boarding students rest and to take their meals with their family.  Some professors and tutors are ill.  Preventative measures were taken against the malady at the high school. The communal schools are strongly affected.  The rumors of dismissal of the Borda are false.  Last night, at the theater, during the playing of the patriotic play, Carnot, several artists fell ill, suddenly, in scene. In Bourges (From a correspondent) Bourges, January 6. - Several flu cases were recently reported in the 37th artillery regiment. The superintendent of the Academy recently decided that the vacation of the high school, which should have ended tonight, are extended to next Sunday, January 12. In Chalons-on-Mame Chalons, January 6. - The influenza takes worrying proportions here.  The garrison is particularly affected.  At the school of Arts and Trades some sixty students are staying in bed.  The caves are not much better. The population is worried.  It is time to take vigorous measures. In Montpellier (From a correspondent) Monpellier, January 6. - The published information, on the sanitary state of Montpellier and which can appear exaggerated, were unfortunately founded. There were registered, from January 1st through 4th, 51 deaths, being 13 per day, while the average number of deaths for the year 1889 was from 5 per day. In Nimes (From a correspondent) Nimes, January 6. - Almost all the public services are disorganized.  The postal and telegraph administration especially is harshly mistreated.  It had to resort to military authority, which provided soldier telegraphists to replace the sick employees. In the railroad, each day there is another case produced.  Consequently, the service is having great difficulty. At the natural gas factory, 23 employees are abed. The mayoral personnel is almost totally sick with influenza.  The offices are almost completely deserted.  There are only a few employees still working hard. Several of our colleagues from the local and regional press are equally bed-bound; the other less-tried people, laboriously watch over their occupations. In Toulouse (From a correspondent) The epidemic continues in Toulouse.  The portrayal of Hamlet, announced for the night of the day before yesterday, had to be postponed due to sickness. The postal and telegraph personnel are still well-tried. The morning of the day before yesterday, the auxiliary office of Dupuy Place had not been opened at the normal 1 o'clock, none of its employees intended for service being sent to the office. The administration had to replace them with employees from the central office, and the regular service went back in the afternoon. In Tourcoing (From a correspondent) Tourcoing, January 6. - The influenza intensifies every day in Tourcoing; several postal employees are affected.  But it is above all the police who are the most tried.  Saturday night, 14 agents of 34 had to cease their service. The number of cases, at this time, certainly passes a thousand. In Valonne (From a correspondent) Valonne (Lower Alps), January 6. - The influenza has made its appearance, some fifteen days ago, in this little community. 40 cases of a thousand inhabitants are already counted. In Germany (From a correspondent) Berlin, January 6. - The princess of Bismarck was affected by influenza. The empress Augusta had a bad night and could not sleep, due to the fever that had come back last night.  The progress of the malady matches that of influenza.  The empress's forces are sufficiently maintaining. The Berlin Clinical Review reports that in this town the cases of influenza appear to have a tendency to diminish in number, but that, however, they lose their benign character that they had at the beginning.  It especially happens very often that recovering people are interrupted by very dangerous relapses. In Stuttgard, there is not, it appears, a single family that has been spared, nearly all of the population is sick. (From a correspondent) Berlin, January 6. - During the week of December 15 through 21, ten cases of fatal influenza were registered; in the same period they had to report a notable resurgence of maladies that were the consequence of the epidemic.  These maladies were more frequently than ordinary followed by death. In England (From a correspondent) London, January 6. - A resurgence of influenza is reported in London this morning.  Many office employees, belonging to the State and to the commerce, are ill.  This resurgence is attributed to the humidity of the atmosphere. In Austria (From a correspondent) Vienna, January 6. - The epidemic continues to strike in Vienna.  All the hospitals are packed.  Several relief funds in case of sickness, had to suspend their payments, their funds being exhausted. The epidemic also spreads outside the capital and in Hungary. In Spain (From a correspondent) Madrid, January 6. - The king has had a relapse.  Since yesterday, he has been suffering from a violent bout of fever. The influenza is making rapid progress outside the capital.  In Valencia notably the population is very tried. In the United States New York, January 6. - The epidemic grows in New York. - Yesterday the mortality reached extraordinary proportions.  Many deaths are due to the flu.

In each house, depending on the number of occupants, 2, 3, 5, to 12 people are sick with the influenza. Two thirds of the shcool children are affected by this fever. The schools are closed until the 13th of January by the order of the school commission. In the orphanage of St. Wolfgang about 20 children should lie prostrate from the influenza.

The terrible influenza that has affected the majority of the continental governments and their leader has without a doubt influenced the total abandonment of the idea of war. There is great hope that we can find a better preservation of peace.          The Tudor Exhibition opened today in the new gallery on Regent Street. It is full of object of historical interest.          Among the many volumes that came from Lord Spencer’s library in Althorp are precious editions of Shakespeare, Spencer, Moore, Marlowe, Bacon, Johnson, and other famous writer of this period. There is also a complete series of English Bibles from Tyndal’s Pentateuch in 1634 to the authorized version in 1661 which completed the work begun under the Tudors. The great Bible of Henry VIII, the Bibles of the Geneva Convention, those of Matthews, the Bishops, the Rheims Bible, and the Donay translation join the collection along with the Irish and Gaelic versions.          Among the painting is a copy of the celebrated painting of Queen Mary, painted by Philip in the era when marriages were arranged for the couple ever met.          The Queen has ordered that the court be in mourning for 30 days for the death of the former Brazilian empress.          There is an abundance of reports about the great precautions that St. Petersburg has taken especially among those close to the czar. Only those who are of his utmost confidence in his personal service are admitted into his presence. Guards and sentries have multiplied both inside and outside of the palace. The czar is in a constant state of alarm, bordering frenzy. Even those who are allowed to serve him are afraid to be the victim of a fit of violence born of his constant state of excitement.          The influenza has invaded London and in many homes half or even more of the residents are in bed.          The reports, except those of Dr. Peters, are full of caution as almost everyone in Berlin believes the prior report that he has been assassinated by the Arabs. However, it seems to be true that he is alive. The conflict that exists in Southwest Africa exists because the Germans have revoked their order only days before the rumored murder.          Dr. Donner, the doctor for the court in Munich committed suicide today.          Russian government workers responsible for managing railroads have discovered a series of robberies that has been going on for quite some time on the Sebastopol route. The robberies were worth hundreds of thousands of rubles. 	Spanish

It is currently just as serious in Mexico. Of the 70 people who spent the night in the homeless shelter last Monday, 40 became sick with catarrh.          The disease is spreading in such a way that in the homes and factories of the capital, more than 50% of people are under the influence of the catarrh influenza.          Today what we do not know is if the epidemic is contagious, in the theaters for example, where people congregate.          It would be great if the Superior Council on Public Health informed the public of their opinion on the matter to help calm those who are witnessing the contagion.”         Our report conforms to that of the Pabellion Español. The reigning catarrh is not serious but it is very common that it develops into pneumonia or choler in which case the patient runs the risk of death.	Spanish		
178	La Lanterne	Paris				1890-01-09T00:00:00Z	http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75053733	THE EPIDEMIC In Paris, outside Paris, and abroad The most recent variation that appeared in the state of the atmosphere seems to have a diminishing of the mortality number as a consequence. On the other hand, the number of people infected by influenza is in serious decline, and, if it doesn't make new disturbances, there is evidence that the epidemic is on its decline. Yesterday, actually, the number of burials only rose to 327. Despite this noticeable improvement, the administration of the Public Assistance continues to take all necessary measures to assure the good functioning of all medical aid services. In Chalons-on-Mame Chalons, January 7. - The epidemic follows a progressive and worrisome march.  On this subject, we will ask the Minister of Commerce why the students of the School of Arts and Trades are not dismissed.    Of a headcount of about 270 students, 140 are sick! The measures taken are insufficient.  The minister and the direction of the School assume a grave responsibility. In Lille Lille, January 7. - The influenza seems to be making progress in Lille.  The doctors are on red alert.  At City Hall there are numerous sick people, notably in the public works service. In Tourcoing, the home-health aides became nowhere to be found and in many families everyone is confined to bed. In Lyon Lyon, January 7. - The influenza still exercises its ravages.  Yesterday, Monday, there were 40 burials; today, there are 60.  This morning a thick fog made automobile traffic difficult. In Marseille (From a correspondent) Marseille, January 7. - The influenza in Marseille followed a very pronounced upward march and the deaths, for the past six days, reached a total of 359.  It was only up to 171 during the corresponding period of 1889.  Over half of the primary school teachers are sick and the opening of the communal schools, which should have happened yesterday, was postponed to an indeterminate date.  We had to appeal to the military administration by telegraph to ensure their service.  Within the 1st Parachute Hussar Regiment, 160 men of 800 are bed-bound. At the excise office, 145 employees, of 785, had to abandon their post; 360 customs officials, of 1,200, are in the same situation. At the railroad, there are 269 sick of a personnel of 1,443 men.  500 workers or employees of the tobacco factory, of 1,300, were missing yesterday at roll call in the factories.  At the Tramway Companies and in the large administrations, a good fifth of the employees are not in a state to do their job. The hospitals are overflowing with sick, and, to satisfy the larger number, they had to install extra beds; the deaths there grew in a proportion of 50 %. The epidemic seems to be at its peak and yesterday was marked by 89 deaths, a number rarely reached during the cholera of 1885. In Nimes From a correspondent Nimes, January 7. - The mortality in Nimes, which, ordinarily, is about 5 per day, rose yesterday to 16. In the 55th infantry regiment, the number of sick passed 100 of a number of 1,000 men.  The two artillery regiments, still more tried, were close to four hundred men affected.  All were treated in a separate barracks. The little quickness of the railroad, the gas factory, and several important factories have half of their personnel abed.  At Pont-Saint-Esprit, the garrison, which has 500 men, has 200 sick who are treated in the hospitals or in the barracks.  The mortality, in this town, has not risen. In Rouen (From a correspondent) Rouen, January 7. - The influenza recently made some new victims in this town where one of the most important services, the excise office, was just hit. This service comprises about three hundred employees; the morning before yesterday, sixty of these employees called in sick, infected with the malady. Consequently, the situation has become most difficult, and during the day the public weight service had to be eliminated.  This service will restart its normal functioning when the number of valid employees  permits. On the other hand, Elbeuf can no longer be lit from one moment to the other. Of sixteen drivers employed at the town gas factory, only three are still doing their job, the others are victims of the epidemic that also affected a part of the personnel. In Italy (From a correspondent) Rome, January 7. - The influenza has taken a rather considerable improvement these past days in a few corps of troops of various garrisons, in particular in the military colleges. The superior military sanitation authorities advise most formally to give no permission, the evil as well as its epidemic character are obviously taking on contagious forms. It is, consequently, necessary to avoid all that can favor its spread. In Spain (From a correspondent) Madrid, January 7. - According to the Impartial, it is assured that the doctor Reidel, doctor of the regent, had a meeting with Mr. Sagesta, to whom he declared that he believed that the young king was shortly entering recovery.

Scholars will not agree about the character of the "influenza" for a long time; this is shown by the negotiations of the Berlin Society of Internal Medicine. The same group dealt with the essence of the added complications, healing, and the transferability of the influenza which is now prevailing in the world, in a most detailed way, at their meeting on 6 d. M. In a resumé led by Councilor Leyden, he said that the disease is by no means different from that which occurred in earlier times. Overall the epidemic has a benign course. In the course of the discussion Professor Fürbringer pointed out, that the benign character of this years epidemic has lost its benignity in the final weeks and days. In the fourth week of December, the movement of the influenza  in the hospital of Friedrichshain imposed a physiognomy, which could almost be considered a terrifying thing. This view came towards Professor Ewald, by stating, that in the entrance of such severe cases, the outcome of the disease is not always determined by the influenza. He also, considerately, drew attention to the severe complications with the inflammation of the skin of the brain, which he had the opportunity to  observe in one case. Professor Henoch , the same as Fräntzel, turned against those models, which deny the representation of the contagiousness. Medical consulstant S. Guttmann brought the following coverage about the transferability of the illness : The training ship "La Bretagne" is  in the port of Brest (France) with a crew of 300 men. The influenza reigns there since the 14th of December to January (?). From the crew, 244 men are now stricken. The illness took from the moment of its beginning, when one officer from Brest, who was afflicted with the influenza, came on the ship. On the side of the "Bretagne", the training ships "Borba" and "Austerlitz" were moored and so far have had no cases of the influenza. Sir Dr. Lazarus said he would make a collective research to clarify the many questions about the claim.

In the latter village, two more people succumbed to the disease in the local consular district of Soulce. In Pruntrut almost one third of the population has fallen ill, the majority of the residents in Bonfol, Courtemaiche, Cornol, Frégiécourt, Pleujouse, Courgenay, Alle, Lugnez, and Damphreux (all municipalities of Pruntrut). In Grandfontaine, Miécourt, and Soulce, the schools must be temporarily closed.

206	Freiburg Nachrichten	German Empire; Austro-Hungarian Empire; Stuttgart; Pest; Bulgaria; Ruse; Tarnovo; Plovdiv; Vienna; Italy; Rome; London; England; Stonehouse; Belgrade; Serbia; United States of America; New York 		Freiburg		1890-01-14T00:00:00Z		Once more the Influenza.   In nearly all the states of the German Empire, as well as in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, an increase in the cases of illness was reported. In Stuttgart, the railway personnel for freight traffic had to be restricted to 240 men because of the influenza. Upon a further increase in the number of those sick the passenger trains should be shut down. In the garisons of Würtemburg, 2000 soldiers are sick with influenza.   In Bulgaria, the influenza treads increasingly strongly in both the capital city Sofia and in the provincal cities. Namely in Ruse, Tarnovo, and lately also in Plovdiv numerous cases have been found. Because of the lack of doctors and infirmaries a wailing rules among the suffering part of the population. 70 to 100 perscriptions per day come to one doctor to be written. As a result of this the apothecaries are also so taken up, that they can hardly satisfy the demands. The military and the school children suffer the most from this illness. A speedy extinction of the plague is not thought about in the described unfavorable circumstances. To this end the emergency and the warm sometimes humid temperature joined, which makes the contagiousness still greater.   In Vienna, the local council granted the coporate health insurance funds, whose monetary holdings were severely taken in claims as a consequence of the influenza, a grant of 10,000 guilders.  In Pest, the minister of education authorized the capital cities authorities to close all the education institutes for a long time because of the influenza.   Also in Italy, the influenza already made itself noticable, however it treads where the climatic conditions are milder, rather than in the colder northern states. The disease spreads more and more to Rome; the deaths due to the influenza have not yet been reported from there.  Reported from England, that the influenza has now held a retret from the garrisons of the megapolis London. The closing of the regimental schools in Tower for the purpose of the conversion of the rooms into hospitals was probably necessary. The hospitals are generally taken very strongly by claims. The working circles were the hardest hit, who are busy as carters or carriers on the Thames or in the vegetable markets. In the King's Marine hospital at Stonehouse, many sailors are laid low as a consequence of the influenza, which hit them in the middle of the sea. In London, the death rate also increased significantly.  A cessation of the influenza was reported from Belgrade, on the other hand it spreads ever further in the interior of Serbia.   The latest news from America says the influenza wins more and more ground; in New York City, the death rate has already reached a very high degree. A letter in the the "Times" wants to ascribe the origin of the influenza to the large floodings in China in the course of the past year. The terrible sludge which covers long distances of the trodden shores of the Yellow River and the burning summer sun generates in this, with the fertilizer and the trash of a numerous population, a saturated covering for millions of germs, who then through the simulataneous strong winds, are carried out into the world. The current influenza would thus have occured from the dried out surface of the chinese province Honan.

The epidemic is in obvious decline in almost all the quarters.  In some, even, it seems to have totally disappeared.  On the advice of the medicinal services of the hospitals of the right bank, the Pitié, the Hotel-Dieu, the Charité, etc., etc., the sick housed in the 5th arrondissement and presenting complications resulting from influenza are becoming more and more rare. It is not the same in the quarters neighboring the hospital Saint-Antoine, where cases of influenza, still very rare some eight days ago, have become very frequent among the carpenters and the cabinetmakers of the Saint-Antoine district. There are certain workshops where half the personnel, some fifteen workers, came all at once to receive treatment at the Saint-Antoine hospital. Also, to diminish, to the extent possible, the admissions to the hospital for those sick with the flu that can be treated at home, to the condition that they be helped there, medications, prescribed at the consultation very generously by the doctors of the hospital, are delivered for free to the sick people who also receive, at all times when it is necessary, immediate financial aid at the hospital, even. This delivery of aid and of medications is heard, in certain cases reported by the doctors, by the feverish sick people affected by other diseases and that they otherwise needed urgent admission to the hospital. Warm clothes, given by the minister of the interior, are otherwise distributed to those sick or recovering from the flu, insufficiently covered, and for those, consequently, whose complications would ensue. These measures have, for several days, diminished to about 400 the number of admissions that imposed themselves among the sick presenting themselves to the advice of the Saint-Antoine hospital. The number of treated sick at this hospital, which was 946 on January 8, has fallen to 911 during the day of the 9th and to 914 the 10th. In Beauvais (From a correspondent) Beauvais, January 12. - The influenza makes considerable progress in Beauvais.  50% of the population is sick. All of the administrations have their personnel sick.  At the post office they had to replace the office employees with soldiers and postmen from the countryside by a new means unknown as of now.  The director of postal services sent particular correspondences to the mayors of certain communes through the mediation of Mr. Jouvin, car renter, and each mayor distributed it through the village police officer or the communal railway worker. In Bourges (From a correspondent) Bourges, January 12. - The epidemic seems to tend toward improvement.  However grave cases followed by death are more numerous. At the hospital, the state is noticeably improved.  The Marine hospital is filled with sick.  The number of sick passed 800.  The minister of the Marines has prescribed a daily allocation of three grams of tea and ten grams of sugar per rationer for the duration of the epidemic.  The situation of the high school has become satisfactory again.  An improvement is reported on the battleship Requin. In Marseille (From a correspondent) Marseille, January 12. - The number of deaths in Marseille was 77 yesterday.  At the high school, whose re-entry was held Friday, a quarter of students were missing, of about 400.  Three professors are sick. In Nimes (From a correspondent) Nimes, January 12. - The re-entry of the high school and professional school students, which was supposed to be held today, was postponed. A later notice will make known the date of the re-opening of courses. The sanitary state of the town stays the same and appears to have a tendency to improve. In La Rochelle La Rochelle, January 12. - The epidemic continues to strike in La Rochelle with a great intensity.  The sick are in the proportion of 30% of the population.  But the sickness has a very benign character.    Not a single case has been reported to have become grave.  Certain serious complications that have been reported are the consequence of imprudences committed, or of morbid predispositions previous to the start of the epidemic. In England (From a correspondent) London, January 12. - The epidemic is in noticeable decline. The marquis of Hartington is rather seriously ill.  The doctors have reported the beginnings of pulmonary congestion; however his state does not inspire any concern.

The number of persons afflicted with the Russian influenza or la grippe, the malady which has set two continents to sneezing within the past two months, seems to be largely on the increase in Roanoke, but no alarm need be felt over the manifold discomforts of the epidemic if ordinary precautions are taken and the rest and retirement which the doctors urge is observed. The favorite remedy for the disease seems to be quinine and antipyrine. The TIMES reporter on inquiring at the drug store found that the sale of these two medicines had largely increased since the malady first made its appearance in our midst.

The epidemic is in obvious decline today on all points. In the 11th arrondissement, where we reported these last few days some resurgence among the working class of the Saint-Antoine district, the situation has improved a lot, and it's barely if one counts some new cases and some new requests for admission to the hospices for consecutive flu infections. The colleges and high schools, of which, we know that the vacations had been prolonged, had their re-entry yesterday. All over, the sanitary situation is excellent and reported absences are very rare. The deaths reported in Paris during the day of last Saturday rise to 296, those declared during yesterday to 247.  It is useful to note, however, that the declarations of death are always less numerous on Sunday than on other days. Finally, the burials that were proceeded to during the day rise to 222. The prefect of the Seine, accompanied by Mr. Felix Voisin, vice president of the surveillance council of the Public Assistance, by Mr. the professor Lannelongue, member of this council, by Mr. Peyron, director, and by Mr. Derouin, secretary-general of the Public Assistance, visited the Beaujon hospital and the Lariboisiere hospital yesterday morning.  He reported that the rooms of both hospitals were much less burdened and that a smaller number of sick presented themselves to the doctor's office, which indicates a marked decline of the epidemic. In Dunkerque (From a correspondent) Dunkerque, January 13. - Our marines are not spared by the fashionable malady. Several cases of influenza were declared aboard the vessels moored in our basins.  Some ships saw their departure held back and others left despite having everyone sick aboard. We add that there also the sickness keeps its benign character. In Maubeuge Maubeuge, January 13. - The garrison is tried by the influenza.  The 145th infantry regiment has around 100 sick.  The artillery, proportionally, had even more affected.  In the factories, at all times, workers have to leave. All the administration of the town was attacked, there are hardly any houses where they don't have three or four sick. In Saint-Etienne (From a correspondent) Saint-Etienne, January 13. - The influenza continues to strike with some intensity in Saint-Etienne. The affected people are in the thousands; there are few families who don't have one or several ill; it isn't the strikes in the workshops, factories, or manufactories that have provided a respectable share of influenza-sick people. At the arms factory, the flu-sick are in the hundreds; numerous ribbon workshops are reduced to half their numbers; many cases at the barracks. The police service has been strongly affected: some thirty corporals or agents are currently sick; one of them, the agent Rebeaud, succumbed yesterday.  The malady had kept up until yesterday a benign character, the fatal cases were proportionally few in number.  The number of deaths of the 1st to the 11th of January inclusively was 139, of which 20 were for yesterday. It had been 90 for the corresponding period of 1889 and 116 for that of 1888.

At the present time, all administrative and public services, somewhat overworked recently by the absence of part of their personnel, went back to regular service. At the Polytechnic School and in the high schools which, we have said, made their re-entry yesterday, the sanitary state is excellent.  The new consecutive cases of influenza, sent to the doctor's office, are becoming more and more rare.  The statistics, finally, report 291 deaths for Monday and 256 burials for yesterday. We have been sent the following note: To respond to the numerous demands, the commission of clothing established by the minister of the interior reminds the public that the clothing distributed by this aid is not destined uniquely, nor first memo taken, to the ordinary clientele of the offices of charity, but of a general manner, to the poor workers sick with the flu. If the distribution occurs by the kind intermediary of the offices of charity, it's because these establishments offered personnel facilities and materials that one could not acquire elsewhere except at high prices, that is to say at the expense of the workers themselves.

Our readers will no doubt have noticed the news received in the colonies in reference to the great out break of influenza in the Northern Hemisphere, and the dread with some people of the epidemic making its way put here. The whole question, as to the spreading of the disease, is an open one as yet. Lately it has become the fashion for scientific men to attribute everything to a microbe, and so now it is thought that the disease is due to the presence in the atmosphere of some minute organism of a specific nature which is distributed over wide areas, and which, when introduced into the bodies of those attacked multiplies, indefinitely, and becomes a source of infection by the breath. And as to the transit of the disease some of the latest authorities say that it travels from east to west and apparently has its real beginnning in Asia, as had the previous outbreaks of influenza. Like them, it is independent of sanitary arrangements, for it is found in some of the best drained cities in the world ; and of personal habits, since it attacks people of all ranks. Unlike typhoid, it aims at no particular age, and, unlike cholera, it does not specially exist in filthy and ill-drained places. Finally, it seems to travel almost with the rapidity pf a bush fire. These are .the main characteristics of the epidemic, and they represent what has previously occurred. According to an article in the Encyclopedia Brittannica, the disease has always gone from east-to west, and has been known to compass Europe in six weeks. On former occasions Australia has run no danger, but the question may now be asked whether, in these days of rapid and constant communication, there is any likelihood of the epidemic reaching the colonies? The number of cases in the Landon General Post Office seems to show that the infection may be spread by letters. Is there any chance that it could thus be carried over such a great distance as separates Australia from European countries? We cannot tell, but are inclined to believe that South Australians need have no fear.	English	Dread; epidemic; Microbe; Infectoin; Sanitation; Cholera; Communication; Epidemic

From all sides gifts will be sent to the public poor relief, yesterday in Werthe around 50,000 Francs were given, which will be shared by the infirmaries and charity institutes. In Lyon, the warehouse of a large silk dealer was burnt on the 12th of December, the damage was estimated at 1.5 million francs.  Gurmels. (Sent in from a reader).

For the influenza or other illnesses, in which the appetite and the strength is lost, we can best recommend a cure with the genuine Eisen cognac of Colleiz, the efficacy of which is proved sufficient through the shining results, the same results were obtained  in the last 16 years. Excellent strength and means of recovery. The only one rewarded in Paris in 1889 and Barcelona in 1888 and which was decorated with 19 other diplomas and medals.

A few days ago in Vienna, Professor Rothnagel  presented to his listeners a case of pneumonia, which has appeared in the patient concerned in the course of the "influenza".  In connection thereto, Profesor Rothnagel gave some interesting exclusions on he relationship that exists between the two illnesses, influenza and pneumonia. It is an absolutely false view, says Professor Rothnagel, if this relationship, as is done on many pages, would be interpreted in a manner, that pneumonia, which appears in the ill in the course of the influenza, can only be induced through influenza. The epidemic of pneumonia has nothing to do with the influenza epidemic. Both infectious diseases are consistently caused by different factors.  Before the incursion of the influenza in Vienna, the pneumonia epidemic was broken. The appearances of pulmonary affections were initially, as they still appeared alone, of a milder nature; with the sudden onset of the influenza, the symptoms of pneumonia escalate to a very alarming degree. Namely, since the mucous membranes of the bronchi are inflamed as a result of attacks, mostly occurring in the influenza, they put the same immigrant air from the cocci, so they have much less resistance than normal, healthy mucosa. Hence, once can say, that the influenza provides favorable conditions for pneumonia. Influenza alone is not sufficient to cause pneumonia.

The "Grütlianer" makes the following suggestion, it will not be a lack of diverse support, that makes the fulfillment less easy: "The workers health insurance funds, in particular the sections of our Grütli health insurance funds, are currently provided a difficult test by the violently rampant influenza.  All funds are taking an extraordinary way to be claimed and it is hardly possible to change, since a large deficit has emerged. At such times as it is here, that the state and the municipalities will not leave the care of the health insurance on the shoulders of the weak alone.  Since the government grants would be justifiably be doubled and tripled. In Vienna, the government and city council have recognized this and approved good totals. Who will mimic the example of Switzerland ? Zurich. In the city of Zurich, they seem to have fairly accurate and organized statistics about those ill with the influenza among the school children. From the same statistics it is apparent, that approximately two thirds of all the school children have become ill.  Lieutenant Colonel Graft is not dead, he is situated on the road to recovery.

The new that I’m currently presenting appeared first in the medical newspapers beginning on December 18th of last year.          The epidemic extends from Russia to Denmark, passing through Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and France into Portugal. The spread has occurred with extraordinary rapidity. The most highly populated areas have been the most affected by this disease. The number of of affected has been highest in the capitals of the states we’ve just mentioned. The disease has always begun in sites where many people congregate such as hospitals, military barracks, warehouses, factories, and even on ships. It attacks those who are in the most immediate contact with the sick. For example, in one hospital in Vienna 300 sick infected 77 doctors and 58 nurses. Dr. Ehlers of Denmark says that the disease was most likely imported on a ship from Russia to the Engineering Barracks and from there it spread to the other military establishments while it had very little effect on the civilian population. In one port in Holland there were 70 sailors of the same warship affected at once.          The epidemic, although one disease, has varied symptoms in different countries to the point that in some countries such as France, there was doubt as to whether to treat the disease like Grippe or like the Dengue fever. In the majority of locations it has been marked by catarrh-like respiratory mucus. In Paris its been dominated by gastrointestinal accidents and the phenomenon generally marked by symptoms of the nervous system. In many of the infirm there have been outbreaks of rashes similar to those associated with scarlet fever, and in others, intense joint pain.          [Here two indecipherable paragraphs have been omitted]         I’m going to condense the news he have to date into propositions relating to the epidemic in Europe:          A. The disease has spread with the most rapidity due to the communications by railroads.          B. In some ports the disease has been spread by ships that arrived from infected locations. Copenhagen, Liverpool, and Manchester were all infected by ships from Russia.          C. The epidemic has infected a great number of people at the same time. Dr. Schnirer of Vienna communicates that they cannot calculate or approximate the number of affected people. The telegrams from Munich say there are 40,000 cases.          D. The epidemic is most common in locations where there is a large accumulation of people. Examples include the Louvre warehouses, general hospital of Vienna, Engineering Barracks in Copenhagen, sailor in Hellevetzlonia, Holland, and schools in London.          E. The disease presents itself differently by location. This made several doctors of the Academy of Medicine in Paris to label the disease Dengue.          F. The disease was benign at first as proved by reports in the Medical Journals of Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Saint Petersburg, etc. beginning on December 18th.          G. The epidemic has subsequently taken on a considerably more grave character. It was predicted by Mr. Ollivier of the Paris Academy and professor Nothnagel of Vienna, and it has been confirmed by telegrams for the past 15 days.          H. The number of people affected simultaneously is so considerable as to make it very difficult for hospitals to take in all the infirm.          From this list of propositions there are several practical deductions that are applicable for us:          1. We cannot prevent the spread of this disease across our borders.          2. It is possible to avoid the spread of the disease by means of our ports.          3. It is convenient to prohibit great accumulations of people and to disseminate those that exist.          4. It is not possible to write instructions about the disease until we know the character it will take when it presents itself here.          5. The epidemic of Grippe that is currently reigning in Mexico is benign but it may acquire a more grave character.          6. We can hope that the disease will not take on a character more grave than it had in Europe in Mexico City because in the torrid zone and the Central Plateau the worst of winter has already passed.          7. The Council will propose to the authorities at the appropriate time what they ought to do to assist the poor who become sick in case the disease takes on an alarming character.          8. It is convenient to encourage the meeting of Charity Boards according to the Council’s instructions on cholera.          Mexico, January 9, 1890--Signed, E. Liceaga.”         With the council’s permission we had the privilege of transcribing this report for better understanding and results.          Liberty and Constitution.

The Paris local council has used the increased mortality due to the influenza, in order to carry on the cremation of the bodies en masse. A year ago the council had erected the first crematorium-oven on the Peré la Chaise, which needs two hours in order to turn a body to ash. Recently the second oven is been put into operation, and it only needs one hour, and needs even less to operate. Together, as of now 735 bodies have been burned. The influenza caused such a rise in the mortality, that the mortuary community had to hire 160 new horses and corresponding teams. Against all tradition, burials have started early every morning. In the hospitals bodies have become yet more frequent. For this reason so many were burned.

246	Influenza					1890-01-27T00:00:00Z		From the medical side, we get the following very interesting and thought provoking article about the prevailing pandemic. From everywhere, from the highest north and the sunny south, from the old and new world come without interruption reports about the spread of the influenza. According to reliable estimates, it may be assumed, that overall, where the pandemic has prevailed, over 50% and at most 75% of the population were taken by the illness, and indeed all classes without distinction and all age groups except around childhood, where they had a higher or lower degree.  It is remarkable, that as far as our observations and inquiries reach, the plague always occurred first in the large population centers and only gradually moved (however relatively swiftly) into the surrounding, scattered country areas.   Whereas the influenza alone,  meaning without complications, very rarely leads to death, it is on the other hand very often fatal for all those weakened by chronic diseases, and can even be fatal for strong individuals  by adding an acute illness of the breathing organs (for example pneumonia), their formation is favored by the influenza, if nothing is caused directly, an unfortunate outcome can be induced. The mortality has considerably increased to double its previous rate and is rising, because this epidemic previals everywhere. Also in Switzerland, in the last few weeks the mortality has increased about 2 1/3 fold when compared with the same time last year.  The illnesses, which have mainly participated in this increasing mortality,  are above all pneumonia and pleural inflammation and other acute illnesses of the repiratory organs. For example around 4.5 times as many people died in the first week of the new year as did in the first week of last year in the large cities of Switzerland. A significantly increased mortality also shows due to the following chronic diseases: pulmonary consumption (almost threefold),  pulmonary emhysema and chronic lung inflammation, heart disease (almost threefold), infirmity of old age (almost twofold), kidney disease, cancer, and the contrast to the reports from abraod of the decrease in deaths from incfectious diseases is  striking, as a rule of thumb.   As proof, that the influenza may be especially dangerous especially because  it leads to fatal complications, if the afflicted do not protect themselves sufficiently against the evil influences of the weather and generally did not exercise due caution, it may be cited, that adult males from 20 to 60 years old are characterized by a greater mortality than women from the same age group. For the 20 to 40 year old age group for example, in the week before last in the large cities of Switzerland, the total mortality of the male population was 1.5  times that of the female population, but the mortality for acute lung illness was 6  times  higher.   Some comparative figures that different cities give some interesting insights about the forward march of the pandemic in Europe from the east to the west and about the course of the epidemic in different places:		population, morbidity, mortality	http://intelligenzblatt.unibe.ch/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Search&Key=ISB/1890/01/27/2/Ar00211.xml&CollName=ISB_1881_1890&DOCID=116259&PageLabelPrint=2&Skin=BernA&AW=1395258970204&sPublication=ISB&sScopeID=All&sSorting=IssueDateID,asc&sQuery=influenza&rEntityType=&sSearchInAll=false&RefineQueryView=&StartFrom=75&ViewMode=HTML

This bacillus presents a great resemblance with that of pneumonia.          Here are some provided details by Dr. Jolles’ laboratory.         This was in charge of examining the expectorations of the patients, and it was surprised to observe that, during the epidemic, the sputum was containing a great quantity of capsules similar to those of the bacilli of pneumonia, discovered by Dr. Friedlauder.         Guided by the similarity of these micro-organisms that were also found in the urinary sediments of the people attacked by the influenza, what had not been even observed, Dr. Jolles called the attention of the doctors about the possibility of a subsequent appearance of the pneumonia; immediately he established a culture of these isolated microbes from the expectorations and from the urine.         Four days later formed colonies had appeared on a gelatin plate like rounded bodies, well limited, yellowish, and of fine grain, presenting the rounded head like that of the _____, known by “porcelain”.         An expectoration collected in provinces that was equally subjected to examination, gave the same bacilli; only these were less bright and some strongly twisted, than Dr. Friedlauder’s.         The result of these bacilli subjected to the colors of aniline is the same as that of the bacilli subjected by Dr. Friedlauder to the identical manifestations. Using the watery colors of aniline, Dr. Jolles has obtained beautiful samples, but without capsules. In an a practiced examination of the waters of the city the 26th of December, 1889, the same bacilli were discovered, 228 were found in a cubic centimeter, under the microscope they showed under a dual form, rounded from a more clear circle.         They have not even finished the tests that make these animals.

The municipal statistics service has counted, during the 4th week of 1890, 1,147 deceased, a number equal to the average, observed in ordinary weather during the month of January.  The numbers from the first days of the 5th week allow affirmation that the reported improvement is persisting.The Parisian mortality was increased as an indirect result of the flu during six consecutive weeks (from the 50th week of 1889 to the 3rd of 1890 included).  The total number of deceased during this period was 11,647, while the ordinary mortality at this time of year had to have been only 6,419 deceased.  One has to admit, then, that the epidemic directly or indirectly caused the death of around 5,060 people.  Among these victims, a large number were individuals exhausted by chronic maladies. Inflammatory sicknesses of respiratory organs caused 242 deaths.  This number, which is still very large, is broken down as follows: acute bronchitis, 51 deaths; chronic bronchitis, 51; broncho-pneumonia, 48; pneumonia, 92.		Paris Deaths

It adds that the number of deaths from the disease reached 25 in the past few days and that doctors cannot envision a way to prevent the spread of the disease. This is causing many inhabitants to abandon the country and run away terrified.                 Almost no news of the aforementioned diseases has been recieved from Texas by this capital. It seems very unusual that news of such a disease would not get here in the time it took the news to get to New York and then from New York to here by mail. We doubt the news is exact. However, it is advisable that the Secretary of Governing inquire about what is true in such a serious matter, in order to give preventative measures.

The following news, dated London 3rd January, was telegraphed from Albany to the Sydney Morning Herald, on the arrival of the R.M.S. Shannon: The influenza epidemic is now in London, and the doctors have numerous cases, which are undoubtedly similar to the continental disease, though at present of a milder form. The shop assistants of Whiteley and Co. were the first to take the complaint. Nearly 100 were affected, but 200 cases are reported from the Central Telegraph Office, where the work is seriously interfered with. There have been severe cases in the city printing offices, where three deaths are said to have occurred among the printers. Dr. Bernardo's Home for Boys at the East End has been visited by the epidemic, and there have been numerous cases in other parts of London. Among the victims is Lord Salisbury, who was attacked the day after Christmas, and was confined to his room, being compelled to postpone several political fixtures. His two private secretaries are also down with the complaint, and the Premier is said to believe the infection was conveyed to him in the despatches recently received from the embassies at St. Petersburg and Paris, which were written when the ambassadors in both places were suffering from the complaint. The doctors report other cases of patients who are believed to have caught the infection from letters sent from Russia. Among other celebrities suffering from the infection is Mrs. Bernard Beere, who has been unable to appear at the Garrick Theatre since Monday. In Paris the epidemic is decreasing, though there were many resultant cases of inflammation of the lungs, bronchitis, and much pleurisy. The severity of the disease in Paris is said to be aggravated by the insanitary state of the town after the Exhibition. The hospitals continue to be crowded, but the schools and colleges are empty. Lord and Lady Lyons and their son, Lord Knebworth, are all laid up, and many ministers are still on the sick list. In the French provinces the epidemic is raging severely, though there are few fatal cases, except amongst old people. In Germany the disease is still rampant, and numerous cases are causing annoyance. The Grand Duke and Duchess of Radin have been confined to the Royal Palace at Berlin, where they were visiting. Both were prostrated with influenza, and the King and Queen of Saxony are also suffering. In Saxony the disease is very prevalent, and it is almost impossible to carry on the railway and postal and telegraph services, owing to the illness of the officials. In Vienna the influenza is still raging, and the Archduke Frederick and Count Taale are both suffering severely. At present the disease has hardly penetrated into Italy, but some hundreds of cases of a mild type are reported from Rome. Lisbon and Madrid are both centers of influenza, and a deep gloom has been thrown over the latter city by the death of Gayarre, the favourite Spanish operatic tenor, who succumbed to the epidemic with which he was attacked when recovering from a severe affection of the throat.

Epidemic influenza, now so prevalent, is, says the British Medical Journal, a specific fever, which must not be confounded with the local affection of the nose and throat to which the term influenza is commonly applied in this country. It is important that this should be generally recognised, for epidemic influenza, though a mild disease if properly treated, may become dangerous to life if neglected. This is particularly true of the present epidemic, for observers in all countries agree that relapses are very apt to occur. This has been noticed by our correspondents in St. Petersburg, Vienna, and Paris, and a well-known practitioner in the West End of London writes to us, with reference to the cases now and recently under his treatment:- "I am convinced that it is a most dangerous disease to trifle with, owing to the relapses, which, so far as I have seen, have occurred on the eighth day. I think the public shou'd be warned to go to bed directly they have the shivering and lumbar pain." Dr. Proust, in Paris, expresses the same opinion. In his official letter to the Minister of the Interior he warns sufferers that exposure to cold, not merely while the disease is at its height, but during convalesconce, may altogether change the character of the disease. Most of the deaths which have occurred would seem to have been due to imprudence. The attack produces a good deal of anemia and nervous depression, and any imprudence committed before complete recovery may bring on a fatal attack of pneumonia or, bronchitis, which might otherwise have been avoided. The poison of influenza having entered into the system, does not always attack the mucous membranes of the nose and chest. In some persons it is the stomach and digestive, organs which are attacked, leading to violent vomiting or colic and diarrhea; most of the cases hitherto observed in London appear to have been of this class. In other cases catarrhal symptoms of any kind are absent or very slight, but the nervous prostration which ordinarily accompanies is present to a severe degree, the poison appearing to have specially selected the central nervous system.   Physician to patient- "Your case is a very serious. one, sir, and I think a consultation had better be held." Patient, too sick to care for anything-   " Very well, doctor, have has many accomplices as you like."   The celebrated Lessing was remarkable for a frequent absence of mind. Having missed money at   different times without being able to discover who took it, he determined to put the honesty of his servant to a trial, and left a handful of gold on the table . "Of course, you counted it ?" said one of his friends. " Counted it?", said Lessing rather   embarrassed; " no I forgot that,"    	English	Dr. Proust, symptoms, treatments

The following paper by Dr. W. R. Gillette, of the medical department of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, on the above subject, will be read with interest now that the disease has made its appearance in Australia : - "The almost universal prevalence of 'La Grippe " is a matter of so much significance, and threatens to so increase the mortality among the aged and infirm, that we deem a few words of advice will not be amiss, and may aid in contributing to the intelligent treatment of thle disease. "'La Grippe,' is only another name for influenza, which has had many names given it through the centuries of its existence. Thus, it has been called modefieber, or the fashionable fever schapshusten-sheepo cough, blitzkatarrh - lightning cough, Russian catarrah, and influenza, from the Italian, be- cause it was thought to be due to some in- fluence in the air causing it. The term 'La Grippe' comes from ' Gripper,' French, meaning to seize. " It has been known and written about since 1510, and there have been no less than 95 epidemics of it-each one causing the greatest alarm-more, we think, from its general prevalence than from its actual and immediate dangers. " The origin of this morbific influence will, no doubt, now be sought for with renewed zeal, and perhaps be traced to some new and yet unseen microbe germ; but up to the pre- sent time very few data have been collected which can form the basis for any judgment upon the subject. Perhaps the theory of Professor Hecker, who, as a medical his- torian, has carefully studied the epidemics of the middle ages, may be taken in the absence of any settled opinion on the subject, namely, that all epidemics are due to cosmical dis- turbances and unnatural seasons. In his investigation of the black death, which swept away 5,000,000 of people in Europe, he associates with it a startling array of unnatural earthly phenomena. Also in studying the black death in China, he demonstrated that extraordinary deluges, earth quakes, and storms had just preceded it. So with the sweating sickness. He shows that epidemic to have followed fogs, floods, deluges, and unprecedented moisture. "All this was determined before the discovery of the bacillus, and now that we are inclined to attribute all troubles to one form or another of this microbe, it is not at all improbable that volcanic action, or the chemistry of nature evolved by electrical conditions, combined with the well known mephitic conditions, generated by long con- tinued moisture, are sufficient to liberate from the earth, or produce these germs, and thus give rise to conditions which few of us have escaped in the present epidemic of 'La Grippe.' "'This disease is not affected by atmospheric conditions like a common cold, for whether it be hot or cold, foggy or clear, it prevails equally. Location has nothing to do with it, for it is known to be present on ship board in the middle of the ocean, as well as on land; therefore, as Germain See says, 'this virus must be referred to an atmosphere vitiated by a living organism, which multiplies and propagates itself ad infinitum, affecting all individuals without regard to age or constitution, smiting them suddenly without any period of incubation, and dis- appearing after a period of from four to eight week's prevalence.'    "Various attempts have been made to classify the different phases of influenza Thus we have the catarrhal, the digestive, the nervous, the encephalic forms, etc.; but the symptoms of all these forms are so inter- mingled in this epidemic, that it is impossible to individualise them, and not at all necessary for its successful treatment. The main thing for us to know, is that a simple uncomplicated case will get well in three or four days. The danger is mainly dependent on the condition of the patient who gets it. If he is strong and robust, the probabilities are that he will convalesce promptly. If he is enfeebled by age, alcoholism, or the presence of some other disease, the danger is that the accompanying fever and disturbances will develop pneumonia, and prepare the way for permanent lung troubles. "It must be remembered that catarrhal conditions of the mucous membrane, nose, throat, larynx, trachea (wind-pipe), bronchial tubes, and even the ears and eyes may be in- volved in the disease, and must be treated accordingly, The attack comes on in the midst of perfect health, and without exposure to chill as an exciting cause. After repeated attacks of sneezing, there comes a discharge of viscid mucous from the nasal passages, and this rapidly extends until the throat and nearly all the respiratory passages are involved. This is accompanied by dull, and sometimes intense pain of the head and ears, which is the most distressing symptom. "Co-incident with this, or even sometimes before it, the nervous form appears in which there is a great muscular fatigue and exhaus- tion, or the most racking pain in the head, back or limbs. Sometimes the fatigue is so great that the patient will have partial or complete attacks of fainting-then every muscle and bone in the body will ache until the patient is driven to agony. This is ac- companied by fever of, varying degrees, ranging from 100 to 103 fahrenheit and even higher, falling somewhat in the morning and rising again at night with a correspondingly rapid pulse. This may continue for three or four days.  "The digestive form of the infhuenza is probably a simple extension of the catarrhal inflammation of the mouth, nose, and throat to the mucous membrane of the stomach, giving rise to nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting. ''In short, the diagnosis of this disease may be made by the combined symptoms in which sneezing, coughing, and nausea vie with fever, intense muscular pains, and severe rheumatic pains or the joints and bones. "The treatment is simple in uncompli- cated cases; and naturally effective, inasmuch as the disorder is self-iimited, and will cease when it has run its course. "All we can hope, or need to do, is to palliate the painful symptoms as they arise, and await without fear, until they cease. The element of fear is the great fertilizer for this disease, as, indeed, it is for almost every noxious germ, that produces human ail- ments. If the germ is received into a system that is unstrung .and enfeebled by the profoundest of all disturbing human elements- fear, the patient will certainly be in greater peril of disastrous results than if he has the resisting powers given by courage and faith. "The first thing to do when one is taken is   to go at once to bed, and be prepared to remain there three or four days. Then or until the physician can be got, let the patient be treated as, in the ease of a common cold. Administer a hot mustard foot bath, and a laxative to thoroughly, cleanse the bowels. If there is fever give a drop of the tincture of aconite every hour, drink plentifully of water if needed, and eat simply, avoiding alcohol in any form. If there is severe pain or fever the physician will prob- ably prescribe five or ten grains of antipyrine, or perhaps ten grains of Dover's powder, as the case seems to require. Quinine seems to have no effect upon the disease or fever, and opinions differ as to whether it need be taken unless the patient has decided faith in it. "Bear in mind that there is no remedy as   yet known that will cut short the duration of the disease a single day, and the wise man will not drug himself into a resistless state of mind and body, but will be oontent to remain in bed living upon simples, and getting that alleviation from pain and suffering which a skillful physician and attentive nurse will give him."

In view of the reputed outbreak of epidemic influenza in New Zealand, and still nearer at home in Victoria the following report, by Dr. Ashburton Thompson chief mendical inspecter to the New South Whales Board of Health (and who, for a while, some years ago, practised his profession in Brisbane), which was considered by that body at their meeting recently, will be perused with interest by the public generally. At any moment the complain: may make it, appearance in Ipewich, and therefore the suggestions of Dr. Thompson cannot too early or too widely be made known. After hearing the report, the Health Board resolved to furnish the press with copies,in order to at once direct attention to it. Dr. Thompsan's report is as follows:  "The prevention of epidemic disease is effectual in proportion to know edge of their cause, and of the means by which they gain currency, or rp . al upon the large scale. This knowledge is already gained with regard to a few diseases; these therefore, are preventible,. and, in localities, or among limited bodies of people, actually are prevented, more or less   thoroughly, in practice; but influenza is not yet included among them. The cause, and mode of spread, are not known for influenza; they were not understood before the present epidemic began, and the labours carried on, during the past few months, by many ob servors, in many parts of the world, have no, as yet, resulted in the publication of any ex planation of them. It seems, to me, neces sary to be explicit on this point, in order that the public may not expect protection, and may not be disappointed when they find that they have not got it. Effectual measures of prevention against epidemic influenza, cannot, at present be designed, because the cause and spread of that disease are not, at present, understood. No doubt, the idea most generally entertained is that influenza is merely 'catching,' that it has its mode of spread solely in conditions similar to those under which small-pox or scarlet fever spread. This notion requires examination, because the appeal to various measures of quarantine, which has either been actually made, or has been implied in demands for the disinfection of mails and merchandise, naturally flows from it. Upon this point of con tagiousness, then. I observe that it has always been agreed, upon all hands, that influenza is contagious to some quite small extent and within very narrow, although undefined, limits, but it has also been seen always that the property of contagiousness would not account for the observed manner in which every epidemic of it has spread, even though it were possessed in the greatest degree of virulence. The con tagions properties of this fever considered as a means of spread seem, and always have seemed, quite subordinate to some other means which, for the present, remain unidentified. This is a very important point, and perhaps the best way of making it clear will be to give two or three quotations from accepted writings. I choose the words of two English authors, who are of recognised authority; that is to say, who are conspicuous for their known exactitude, caution, and knowledge; and to them I add a third, whose work in the field of historical and geographical pathology is distinguished by the universality of the data from which he draws his conclunsions-a foundation which is indespensable when epidemic or pandemic diseases are the subject of scrutiny. On this question of the contagiousness of infuenza, then, the late Sir Thomas Watson wrote as follows :-'I have observed that Cullen makes this species of catarrah to proceed from contagion (foot- note). But the visitation is a great deal too sudden and too widely spread to be capable of explanation in that way. I will not say that the disease may not be in some degree in fections . . . There are facts in the his- tory of influenza which furnish as a strong presumption that the exciting cause of the dis- order is material, not a mere quality of the atmosphere: and that it is at least portable. The instances are very numerous, too numerous to be attributed to mere chance, in which the complaint has first broken out in those particu- lar houses of a town at which travellers have recently arrived from infected places .... What I wish to point out, now, is that the fact that the influenza pervades large tracts of country in a manner much too sudden and simultaneous to be consistent with the notion that its spread depends exclusively upon any contagious properties that it may possess. You are aware that it has recently seized upon all parts of this metropolis-I believe I may say of nearly the whole kingdom-within the space of a very few days. It has also been ob- served to occur at the same time on land and on board different ships, which have had no communication with the shore nor with each other. Thus it is stated, in the ' Transactions of the Royal College of Physicians," that Admiral Kempenfeldt, on May 2, 1782, sailed from Spithead with a squadron, of which the Goliah was one. The crew of that vessel were attacked with influenza on May 29, and the rest were at different times affected, and so many of the men were rendered incapable of duty by this prevailing sickness, that the whole squadron was obliged to return into port about the second week in June, not having had any communi- cation with any shore, but having solely cruised about between Brest and the Lizard. In the beginning of the same month another large squadron sailed, all in perfect health, under Lord Howe's command, for the Dutch coast. Towards the end of the month-just at the time, therefore, when the Goliah became full of the disease--it appeared in the Rippon, the Princess Amelia, and other ships of the last mentioned fleet, although there had been no communication with the land. Similar events were noticed in the epidemic of 1833. One or two curious instances of the sudden sickening of considerable bodies of men were related to me on very good authority. On April 3 in that year, the very day on which I saw the first two cases that I did see of the influenza, all London being smitten with it on that and the following day, on that same day the Stag was coming up the Channel, and arrived, about 2 o'clock, off Berry Head, on the Devonshire coast, all on board being, at that time, well. In half-an-hour afterwards, the breeze being esaterly, and blowing off the land, forty men were down with the influenza, by 6 o'clock the number was increased to sixty, and, by 2 o'olock the next day, to 110. On the self same evening, a regiment on duty at Ports- mouth was in a perftctly healthy state, but, by the next morning, so many of the soldiers of the regiment were affected that the garrison duty could not be performed by it. I make no doubt that facts of a like nature have oc- curred during the present epidemic, which will be made known in due time. They illustrate important points in respect to the disease viz , the impossibility of accounting for its pre- valence upon the principle of mere contagion, the suddenness of its invasion, and the early and extreme prostration of strength with which it is attended.' -Forty-ninth Lecture. These ex- amples show that direct communication be- tween the sick and the well is not essential to the spread of influenza, not even indirect com- munication each an letters, merchandise, &c., afford. It can over-pass uninhabited areas, such as the sea; it can simultaneously attack large tracts of country : and it can seize al- most simultaneously upon large bodies of men in a way which is nor explicable by analogy drawn from the facts of any other known con- tagious disease. But, in connection with those illustriations, the following opinion, expressed by the late Professor Parkes, after survey of all the recorded facts of influenza, should be read: -" The rapidity of the spread would seem at once to negative any connection between human intercourse and the propagation of the diseases: yet there is some affirmative evidence. It does not appear to follow the great lines of commerce; but when it has entered towns and villages in which the inves- tigation can be carried on, it is curious how frequently the first cases have been introduced, and how often the townspeople nearest the invalids have been first affected .. . So also when it is introduced into a house, it usually attacke one person after another. But if it is introduced in this way, it spreads, afterwards, with a marvellous rapidity, for we cannot dis- [Foot-note : This epithet has referenee to Cullen's noso- logical term catarrhas e contagion ; but, m Perees soys with regard to this phase of Watson's, " It seems to me to imply, however, merely the idea of origin come special virus."  credit the accounts of many individual persons being attacked within a day or two, which is quite different from the slow spread of the contagious diseases. This sudden invasion of a community makes it appear to many persons highly improbable that any effluvia passing off from the sick should thus rapidly contaminate the atmosphere of the whole town "-Reynolds's System of Medicine, article Influenza. Thus Parkes inclines to give the element of contagiousness practical importance, but he keeps it in the subsidiary position already assigned to it, and he is careful to point out how the extreme rapidity with which influenza spreads distin- guishes it from all the known contagia, which only spread slowly. These poison however, are best expressed by Hirren who concludes a paragraph, headed " Alleged Contagiousness" (of influenza), with the following sentences :- "These considerations, taken along with pecularities in the course and incidence of influenza epidemics-their occurrence suddenly and without prelude, and their attacking the people en masse; their equally sudden and complete extinction after a brief existence, generally two to four weeka, and the frequent restriction of the disease to one place while the rest of the country round has been completely free from it-all these points are so foreign to the mode of develop- ment and the mode of spreading proper to such maladies as originate beyond doubt through the communication of a morbid poison, that we shall find it hard to discover any reason for counting influenza among the contagious or communicable diseases." Under these circumstances, then, in which the balance of evidence as well as of probability is against the theory of contagioosnes., while the spread of the disease, not by slow progression, but by leaps and bonds, is certainly independent of contagion, it appears to me that resort to measures of quarantine against influenza would be profit-less against the disease, and would certainly cause very serious monetary lose. All past experience has shown that while any element of contagiousness this disease may possess is never an important element in its diffusion, it can and does spread independently of all those channels which, by quarantine, can be more or less imperfectly closed ; and should resort to quarantine be seriously urged, nevertheless, obviously no scheme short of absolute inter- diction of all communication with the outer world can be logically advocated as long as the cause of the disease remains undiscovered, and as long as precise measures directed to the exact infectious points cannot, for that reason, be devised. I am, therefore, of opinion that all thought of quarantine as a barrier against the introduction to Australia of influenza should be relinquished, and from this conclusion I do not exclude the disinfection of mails. This last measure has been proposed, and even demanded by the public. 'The assertion that the disease can be communicated by letter, however, is, as far as I know. an assumption based upon the probable bacterial nature of influenza (which, however, itself remains unproved thus far); it does not depend upon any proof, at all events. But, however that may be the effectual disinfection of mails is beset with such practical difficulties that it is fortunate that cases in which infection of other diseases is conveyed in that way are not numerous. There are, therefore, but two pre paratory measnres which the Board can take. They are: First, to recommend to local authorities the advisability of causing their districts to be thoroughly and carefully scavenged and cleansed; secondly, to consider the way in which the existing hospital accommodation may be best expanded so as to bear the stress which would undoubtedly fall upon it."

In view of tlie epidemic influenza, the Sydney board of Health has issued the following letter to all medical practitioners: " It is desirable for several reasons that an attempt should be made to record the spread and distribution of influenza in this colony during the present epidemic. The Board of Health would, therefore, request your kind co-operation in collecting infor- mation under the following heads: The date on which the earliest case seen by you occurred, and the town, municipality, or neighbourhood, in which you observed it. The symptoms (in brief, abstract) offered by the first case, and the symptoms (in similar brief abstract) by which the disease is betokened, as deduced from a general comparison of all the cases which have come under your notice. Epidemic catarrh is met with in one or other neighbourhood every year, and you are, therefore invited, to express an opinion regarding the differ- ence between that affection and influenza as it now appears, and to name the symptoms (if any) which distinguish the present disease from epidemic catarrh." When an- swers to these question have been received a tabulated statement of the results will be prepared and furnished to the press. So far there has been no report of a fatal case, but still information is continually being re- ceived to the effect that the disease is fast- ening on to victims in tho city and suburbs. Undoubtedly numerous cases of influenza are under treatment and the present searching weather is looked upon as being a contributory cause; but it is consolling to be assured that up to the present no patient with the disease in a virulent form has come under notice.

BY A LONDON PHYSICIAN. (Chambers' Journal.) There hangs around what are popularly called ‘Colds,' and the catching of them, so deep a mystery that one is more than half inclined to saddle the broad-backed nightmare the bacterium with their origin and cause. The question, When, where, or how does a person catch a cold? is one which is somewhat difficult to answer definitely. The question puzzles laymen, and I on it the doctors themselves differ. The supposed causes of colds are too numerous to mention here, though we may instance one or two. A sudden chill, it is said, drives the blood from the surface of the body towards the interior, to be spread out on the mucous surface of the bronchial or lung tubes, causing erythemo (redness) and a consequent discharge, which is increased by a very bad fit of coughing. Hence, a cold in the chest, and a cold in the head, in the nose, eyes, &c., is explained by the same physiological reasoning. But how seldom do we remember anything about this particular chill, or when we began to sneeze or cough, A sceptic might turn to the doctor and say I take a cold bath every morning all the winter through, and surely that is a sudden chill, yet I never eaten a cold.’ It would really seem that a slow chill - as when one leaves a warm room to sit or stand inactive for some time in a cold one is far more dangerous than any sudden chill, for it acts as a depressant on the nervous system. But supposing that out of a dozen people so exposed three were ill after it, only one perhaps of the three would be attacked by 'cold;' the others might have a kidney or billious attack; for in cases of slow chill it is always the weakest organ of the body that is sought out and affected. Sitting in a draught when hot. There is something of the bugbear about this assigned reason for cold-catching. A man has run half a mile to catch a train, for instance, but it does not follow that he is sure to catch cold if he sits at the open window for a time. In fact the cooling down will do good, so long as it is not carried to excess. A man has been spurting at boating, he is in a bath of perspiration, and hurries on thick jacket and wraps as soon as he gets on shore. Here the bugbear again appears; it would be better far to enjoy the tonic bracing cool air a short time, before hurrying on the nerve-depressing heavy clothing.  If we believe, then, that it is the slow chill rather than the much-dreaded quick chill that is apt to induce colds, we have a finger-post pointing to many dangers we must avoid if we are to keep free of them. We mentioned the cold bath. This is a sudden chill at first, and a glorious tonic for mind and body; but stay not in the water a moment longer than necessary, or the consequences may he disagreeable, to say the least. On the other hand, if the bath, even on a bitter wintry morning, has been brief, the thorough rough-towelling, if done, remember, by one's own hands, not only restores surface circulation, but combines the good effects of dumb-bell exercise and massage. Is the back a little weak or inclined to lumbago? - rub the ioins extra hard. Is the chest liable to be attacked by trifling colds or hoarseness? - rub the front and along the neck and between the shoulders till red. A damp bed will produce the slow chill in the strongest constitution. So will a damp room. It matters but little how cold the bedchamber is, if we are tolerably young and fairly healthy, so long as it is not actually damp, and so long as the bed is comfortable, and that portion of the back between the shoulder-blades kept protected. The slow chill is produced also from damp or wet clothing or feet; not while we keep moving, but after we sit down or stand about, especially if the stomach is empty. Colds are ten times more easily caught if one be fasting.  On the other hand, those who sleep in too warm beds or in over-heated rooms, and who wear heavy clothing to walk in, or those dangerous abominations called waterproofs and goloshes, weaken the nervous system, make hot-house plants of themselves, and open the door not only to colds but a variety of other complaints. The best way to cure a cold is to prevent it. But when one has got it, wise is he if he tries to banish it right away at once. Bed, for rest, may well be enjoined, and an aconite mixture taken every two or throe hours, with but little food— though soda water may be drunk— will usually frighten off the disagreeable visitant in a single night. When there is shivering or a feeling as if cold water were coursing down the spine, three drops of the essence of camphor every half-hour till relief is experienced often acts like magic. Then there is the old-fashioned but good treatment by the liquor of the acetate of ammonia. This may often be adopted with success. But we have our doubts of the efficacy of the hot drink, extra blanket, and mustard-and-water-to-the-feet method of cure, especially in cases where the sufferer hoi to go to office next day. After acute symptoms have been banished, probably by this aconite mixture, and a chronic bronchitic cough remains, there is nothing belter than inhalations of medicated steam or spray. The efficacy of such treatment lies in the fact that tie drug so applied goes directly to the seat of the trouble itself. An ordinary water-jug or decanter, or, better still perhaps, an earthenware tea-pot, may be used. The water should be about 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Fifteen drops of the tincture of iodine or the same of laudanum added to a pint of water makes a good inhalation. The steam is simply breathed about five times to a minute, the inspirations and expirations being deep and long. The remedy may be used three times a day. The compound tincture of benzoin, usually called Friar's Balsam, is used in the tame way a dessert-spoonful to a pint will be enough. In all druggists' shops proper inhalers are sold, and these are beat. We rather deprecate self-doctoring as a rule but the simple remedies we are now mentioning may save much suffering, or life itself, when medical men are not at hand. There are two instruments, then, that no family living away in the country, and no sailor, captain, or yachtsman, should over be without. The first is the clinical thermometer. It is so easily used and a rise in temperature to one hundred degrees, or a degree or two over, means danger. Great pain in the side, for example, with a normal temperature, may be caused by neuralgia or pleurodynia but with a great rise of temperature it means inflammation, and we are to treat for this. The other instrument alluded to is Dr Siegle's spray-dispersing apparatus. The spray is slowly inhaled, the face being some eighteen inches from the nozzle. Breathing, for instance, a warm medicated spray of ipecacuanha wine, one part to three of water, may at first cause a little irritation and coughing but if this remedy is not "rushed," add if used, say, twice a day, relief will nearly always result. It is well to keep to the house for an hour after each inhalation. (To be continued),  	English	Symptoms. Colds.

A Physician on His Own Case. Pride goeth before a fall. I have a profound contempt for germs, and would not mind having them for dinner (as Dr Klein did the cholera bacillus), except those which turn a potato bright red when you grow them on the cut surface. There is something uncanny about that. But most of them "are very harmless when one is in good health; and, in point of fact we do have them for dinner, for we are swallowing and breathing them all day long. Accordingly, on Monday last feeling well enough to resist an entire army corps of germs, I announced my intention of not having influenza, and to emphasize it went to the theatre. During the performance I was seized by a sore throat" and before I got home felt rather queer. After a restless night my sore throat was no worse, and disappeared within twenty-four hours; but I became gradually more and more heavy-headed, and it was clear that the germs had cut off my retreat and got the best of it. On Tuesday night I was feverish—temperature about 101 deg., with aching in the head and back. On Wednesday my appetite went, my head became much worse, and sleep forsook my pillow to a great extent. Once I woke in the night wet through with perspiration, and once or twice I had an attack of coughing. On Thursday I was as weak as a rat, dizzy, still aching dully all over, and could take nothing but tea and toast, Some one kindly brought in all the evening papers. There seemed to me to be nothing in them but the Influenza Epidemic "—how many were smitten here, how many absent there. All that night my poor head was busy extracting epidemic figures from an epidemi, of newspapers, drawing them out in hundreds. On Friday I was, if possible, weaker that ever, but with no fever and much less headache. That night the aching in back and limbs reached a maximum, and I had hardly any rest at all. Saturday: better; went out of doors and wondering at the energy of some people playing football. Sunday: convalescent. The interest attaching to my humble experience such as it is, seems to mc to be this. It was a perfectly pare case of the disorder, unobscured by any collateral symptoms or any effects of drugs. The only medicine I took was a five grain dose of Calomel on Thursday. There was not a trace of coryza (running at the nose) or of gastro-intestinal trouble. The muscular pains were totally different from those of rheumatism. The very slight touch of sore throat (point of inoculation) and of cough just showed what might, and often does, happen. The conclusion I have come to is: that influenza is a simple low fever, noninfectious, but rather of a malarial nature. The term "low fever" requires some explanation. It is not a scientific but a popular term much in vogue some years ago, but now displaced by “the liver." When people were moderately ill in an indefinite sort of way, they used to be said to have  ‘low fever;" nowadays their “liver is out of order." I do not use it in this sense, nor yet merely as a term of abuse in revenge for having succumbed to the malady, but with a definite meaning something like: "asthenic," but not quite the same. By “simple low fever” I wish to signify a fever lasting only a few days and characterized by moderately high temperature, great prostration; and absence of special symptoms. All the other varied symptoms which occur in different cases of influenza seem to me to be secondary to the prostration of strength, and this accounts for their variety. When anyone is reduced to a state of great general weakness he is liable to take on local and special inflammations, as catching cold and so forth. Such inflammations attack the weakest part—in medical Latin, the locus minors resristentice - which varies according to the individual. Influenza induces such a state of weakness, in which the patient is laid open to attack from a number of disorders, according to his own idiosyncrasy, the state of the weather, and the maladies which happen to be prevalent at the time. The tender and sensitive mucous membranes are most usually attacked, and in proportion as they are most exposed to injury. This accounts for the commonest of what may be called the extra symptoms in influenza: running at the nose and eyes, intense frontal headache, sore throat, laryngitis, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Occasionally, matters go further, and we have bronchitis, inflammation of the lungs, gastritis, something very like typhoid fever, rheumatism, and ague. The so-called relapses, of which we have heard so much from the Continent during the present epidemic are in all probability really instances of special inflammation supervening through exposure upon the weakness induced by the influenza. In the case of healthy persons who have no weak spots about them and are not unduly exposed, these extra symptoms do not appear at all, or very faintly, as in my case. Two symptoms are always present —headache (distinguished from the intense frontal variety just mentioned) and pains in the muscles. The one I attribute to the raised temperature, the other to the weakness: and for these reasons. This headache is not different from that which usually accompanies raised temperature: in my own case it rose with the temperature and disappeared with it. The muscular pains, on the other hand, were similarly connected with the weakness, Moreover, I have experienced pains of exactly the same kind before, but induced by two wholly, different causes. One was an excessively lowering climate, the other a slight attack of sunstroke. The only condition common to all three illnesses was the extreme debility. It may be interesting to some people to know that in the case of the sunstroke tea acted like a charm, invariably removing all pain for several hours as completely and more rapidly than does a dose of morphia; and the other day with influenza it had a similar but much leas marked effect. This is the only hint I can give as to treatment, which must be guided in each case by the symptoms present. The fact frequently observed, that an outbreak of epidemic influenza is liable to be followed by one of some other epidemic disorder, is no doubt due to the same cause—namely, that a large number of people are left in a state of prostration, and thereby exposed to any Infection which happens to be in the air. This is the great thing to remember. In itself an unimportant disorder, it renders those who have ft a ready prey to others more dangerous. Keep your eye on the matter of strength. Brazil wanted a national hymn or song or ode, or something of the sort which a fellow might go along bellowing out at midnight after every decent man was in bed, and the native poets responded by sending in over 0,000 specimens. Don’t imagine that all Brazilians pull in their time climbing cocoanut trees.  	English	Symptoms

The severest epidemics that have visited Europe have had their birth place in Asia, and have travelled in » westerly direction, sometimes deflecting to the northward, and sometimes to the southward. The Black Death, which swept off, at a moderate esti mate, 25,000,000 of the inhabitants of Europe in the middle of the fourteenth century, originated in China, moved across to the Black Sea, established itself in Constantinople, and thence spread over the. western continent. The famous plague of Marseilles in 1720, which carried off 40,000 persons, was brought by two vessels from Asia Minor. That of Moscow, by which 100,000 persons perished in 1770, reached that. city from Moldavia and Wallachia by way of Poland and Kief. A ship from Alexandria carried the pestilence to Malta in 1813; and all the visitations of cholera have followed the same route. From the remotest antiquity this malady had been endemic in India among the dense   populations inhabiting the. immense delta formed by the Ganges and the Bramahpootra, as well as Cawnpore, Allahabad, Madras and Bombay. But it was not until 1817, that it began its migratory movement; cross ing Arabia, Persia, and Syria, enter ing the Causasus, and extending its ravages as far as Astrachan, where it paused in 1823, to resume its west   ward march in 1829 ; when it pene trated Russia, established itself in,   Moscow in the year following, and in 1831 and 1832 it overran Poland,   Prussia, Austria, France, Great Britain, Holland, Switzerland, Spain,   and Portugal, visiting Canada, in the   year following. In each of the succeeding epidemics it pursued the   same course, arising in the East, and setting, when it had spent its force, in the West.   The influenza has marked out for itself a similar chart. We first hear of its ravages in Eastern Russia, and it is curious to note that it is believed to have travelled thither from China, and have been occasioned by the burst   ing of the dykes of the Yangtsze Kiang, whereby an enormous area of country was flooded, vast marshes were formed, and an immense amount of miasma was generated. The hypo thesis is not unworthy of attention, because the outbreak of the Black   Death in Europe in 13i8 was pre ceded in 1333 by some appalling floods   in China, in which more than 400,000 persons perished, followed in the next   year by a pestilence which carried off 5,000,000 of the population. At any rate, the coincidence is somewhat   remarkable. Beginning in Russia, the influenza followed: the cholera tracks. It over ran the -whole of Germany and Austria, moved on to France and Belgium, invaded Switzerland, crossed the Alps, and laid its hand upon the whole of Italy including Sicily ; treated the Pyrenees as a mere "geographical expression," and made its hateful presence known in Spain and Portugal ; established itself in Great Britain, and suddenly -appeared in Naw Zealand. In numberless places in Europe .schools have been closed, manufac   tories have come to a standstill, the railway service has been maimed, the   police and soldiers in garrison have been rendered ineffective, and many   of the wheels of commerce have been   brought to an abrupt stop owing to   the tens of thousands of people who have been prostrated by this debilitat ing and depressing malady. And what is very remarkable about it is this, that the purest atmosphere and the very best sanitary conditions do not exempt people from its attacks. If there is one place in Europe in which a resident could calculate upon abso lute immunity from it, it is Daves, in the Engadine. In that derated region the goddess Hygeia was popu larly supposed to have fixed her abode, and last Christmas the two hundred inmates of the chief hotel were com imiserating their less fortunate brothers and sisters who were compelled to   breathe the impure air of crowded   cities or of low and marshy regions ; but between Christmas and New Year's Day one hundred and ninety of the guests were laid upon their backs with influenza, and four or five persons only appeared at the table. At another pension. In which there were seventy inmates, two only escaped the malady, which attacked the whole of the nurses. On the other hand, all the persons employed in the tobacco manufactories of Vevey, Granson, Teufenthal, and other Swiss towns — there are six hundred persons thus engaged in the first of these places — have hitherto escaped the in- fluenza. That it is communicated by contact, and is also transmitted for great dis tances by atmospheric currents, ap pears to admit of very little doubt But there is also good reason to con clude that the liability to take the in fluenza depends to a great extent upon the general health of the subject.'''If this is robust ; if there is do want of tone, in the system ; no undue strain   upon it so as to leave an opening for attack, and no irregularity in the habits and mode of life, there, need be little apprehension of falling within the clutch of la grippe. The investigations of that distinguished bacteriologist, Professor Bouchard, of the French   Academy of Medicine, have gone to prove that there is not one pathogenic microbe in cases of influenza, but three ; which, as he observes, are two too many, if we wish to discover the specific agent of the malady. "Now,   " each of these, "he observes,'' corre     " sponds with particular localizations, " and all three ; are microbes, the     " natural habitants of our cavities, " which under the influence of the " causes of la grippe, or under that of " la grippe itself, are capable of break " ing down the barriers which prevent " them from penetrating our tissues or " our blood." Their destructive   activity, however, seems to commence only under morbid conditions of both ; and therefore the most effectual method of defying the attacks of an epidemic is to maintain all the bodily functions in the highest possible condition of healthful activity and vigour, and to cultivate and preserve that cheerful ness of mind and buoyancy of spirit   which in themselves constitute a good safeguard against the inroads of dis ease.

276	El Dia	Madrid						The Opinion of Doctor Mackenthia This distinguished English physician has published the following observations about the prevailing epidemic: The epidemic that has spread throughout Europe is known as the influenza (in English and Italian), grippe (in French, Portuguese and German), and bone breaker, dengue, and corizon in other countries, but in fact this same condition, which is known with many names should not be considered more than a bad cold, without any unusual symptoms to be especially mentioned. The least intense is on the coast because of the greater mild climate, becoming more developed in the inland and colder populations. There should be no doubt about the cause that has motivated the development of the epidemic; it is simply due to an abnormal cooling of the atmospheric layers. Condensation of oxygen, that is, excess of this gas as a component of the air and its intermittent presence in the ozone, has resulted in the number of strong colds that are neither contagious nor an epidemic. It is easy to check my observation regarding the cause of influenza: the ozonómetro , or simply a strip of paper exposed to air, infused with red litmus or neutral potassium iodide and starch (procedure not rigorously exact) whose role it assumes a more bluish tone the greater the amount of ozone in the atmosphere, which serves as evidence of the periodic presence of this force, and in turn, from this observation the parasitic theory can be discarded, which some attributed to the current disease, because neither effluvia of organic nature or any oxidable principle, are compatible in the ozone. Dealing with such a well-known illness that is as common as a cold, and the cause being the excess oxygen and ozone in the atmosphere, the best preventative route that one can take is to limit oneself from sudden temperature changes; wear very moderate coats, bathe with lukewarm water, never cold nor hot, with constant intake of hot milk. Also, make sure to fumigate rooms with rosemary or thyme. The treatment should also be very simple, except for cases where there are complications, be sure to be on bed rest as soon as the first symptoms are noticed and also diaphoretic mustard foot baths along with high temperature water. Keep in mind that cases where there is overuse or heavy drug abuse often are to blame for having the most cases of dire consequences.
